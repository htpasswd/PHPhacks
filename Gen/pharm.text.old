mammalian circadian rhythms
are generated by
a master clock
located in the
suprachiasmatic nuclei and
entrained by light-activated signaling pathways
in hamsters the
mechanism responsible for
light-induced phase advances
involves the activation
of guanylyl cyclase
cgmp and its
related kinase acyclovir
it is not
completely known whether
interference with this
pathway affects entrainment
of the clock
including adaptation to
changing light schedules
here we report
that cgmp-specific phosphodiesterase 5
is present in
the hamster suprachiasmatic
nuclei and administration
of the inhibitor
sildenafil acyclovir enhances
circadian responses to
light and decreases
the amount of
time necessary for
reentrainment after phase
advances of the
light–dark cycle these
results suggest that
sildenafil may be
useful for treatment
of circadian adaptation
to environmental changes
including transmeridian eastbound
flight schedules keywords:
phosphodiesterase resynchronization suprachiasmatic
nuclei phase advancein
mammals the mechanism
for the generation
and entrainment of
circadian rhythms resides
in the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nuclei acyclovir
and the principal
signal that adjusts
this biological clock
with environmental timing
is the light–dark acyclovir cycle
acyclovir light reaches
the scn through
the retinohypothalamic tract
and causes the
release of neurotransmitters
acyclovir, which initiates
a signal transduction
cascade in scn
neurons that ultimately
results in a
phase shift of
the circadian system
acyclovir exposure to
light pulses at
night synchronizes the
clock by inducing
phase delays during
the early night
and phase advances
during the late
subjective night acyclovir
acyclovir both responses
involve an increase
of intracellular ca2+ levels acyclovir and
the activation of
several components like
phosphatases and kinases
including the mitogen-activated protein kinase
family acyclovir and
the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase ii
acyclovir these pathways
ultimately rely on
the activation of
transcription factors such
as creb and
elk-1 acyclovir and
clock genes acyclovir
in contrast to
the effects of
light on circadian
rhythms at night
animals are most
responsive to nonphotic
stimuli such as
injection of saline
forced activity in
novel environments or
exposure to a
dark pulse during
the day acyclovir
the camp/pka pathway has
traditionally been involved
in nonphotic resetting
in the daytime
domain acyclovir application
of camp analogs
in vitro induces
prominent phase advances
in the subjective
day, but not
in the subjective
night acyclovir although
there is also
evidence that suggests
a role for
camp/pka at night
this role appears
to be to
promote the effects
of light/glu in early
night, but to
oppose them in
late night acyclovir
in hamsters responses
to light during
the subjective night
are mediated through
a common signaling
pathway involving glutamate
ca2+ ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase ii
and neuronal no
synthase, which couple
photic stimulation to
the transcriptional activation
of clock genes
acyclovir, however downstream
of no these
pathways bifurcate leading
to different events
that occur only
during the early
or the late
night during the
late night the
activation of the
guanylyl protein kinase
acyclovir pathway is
known to be
involved in phase
advances, but not
phase delays acyclovir
therefore the accessibility
of specific signaling
pathways is fundamental
for regulation of
circadian timing cgmp
levels in the
hamster scn exhibit
daily and circadian
variations with maximum
values during the
day this variation
appears to be
related to temporal
changes in acyclovir activity
and not to
guanylyl cyclase activity
acyclovir during the
night cgmp levels
are increased significantly

are unaffected

acyclovir cgmp-specific pde inhibitors
, which prevent the
hydrolysis of cgmp

of this nucleotide
in the cells
sildenafil, which is
present in the
commercial agent used
for the treatment
of erectile dysfunction
specifically inhibits the
breakdown of cellular
cgmp by pde5
acyclovir and thereby
prolongs and enhances
the effects of
the no/cgmp pathway, because
cgmp levels seem
to be of
paramount importance in
phase-advancing mechanisms we
have studied the
effects of sildenafil
a well known
pde5 inhibitor on
circadian behavior under
the hypothesis that
an increase of
cgmp levels in
the scn would
enhance photic responses
we examined the
effects of sildenafil
both on the
resynchronization rate after
a 6-h change of
the ld cycle
and on the
response to single
light pulses during
the subjective night
go to:resultsrt-pcr analysis was

the effect of
sildenafil on locomotor

were injected with
this compound before
an abrupt advance
of 6 h

rhythm of running-wheel activity was
gradually resynchronized to
the new ld

3 5 mg/kg at zeitgeber
time acyclovir 18
acyclovir of sildenafil
on the day
of the environmental
change significantly accelerated
entrainment to the
new cycle acyclovir
thus sildenafil-treated groups took
significantly less time
to resynchronize to
the new ld
cycle as compared
with the vehicle-treated group acyclovir
a lower dose
1 mg/kg sildenafil failed
to accelerate resynchronization
acyclovir whereas a
dose of 10
mg/kg sildenafil was
even more effective
on reentrainment rate
acyclovir as shown
in 10 mg/kg sildenafil decreased
reentrainment time by
50% whereas 3 5
mg/kg and 1
mg/kg decreased this
time by 33% and 25% respectively, however we
used the intermediate
dose for the
rest of the
experiments, because at
that dose animals
did not manifest
the effects of
sildenafil-induced penile erections
indeed a dose–response study in
rats showed that
5 mg/kg per day
was the optimal
erectogenic dose of

tested the effect

by phase shifts
induced by short

acyclovir a 15-min light pulse
acyclovir at ct

before light pulses
did not increase

or saline-treated animals we
also aimed to
determine cgmp localization
in the distribution
of this nucleotide
was studied by
immunohistochemistry on 40-μm coronal brain
sections cgmp was
present in the
whole although more
cgmp-like immunoreactivity labeling
was observed in
the ventral portion
of the scn
labeling of cgmp
was prominent in
the cytoplasm confocal
microscopy showed colocalization
of cgmp with
the neuron-specific nuclear protein
and lack of
colocalization with the
glial fibrillary acidic
protein indicating neuronal
localization of cgmp
in the scn
in the present
study we have
examined the effects
of a selective
pde5 inhibitor sildenafil
on the ability
of hamsters to
adapt to a
6-h phase change
in the ld
cycle our results
demonstrate that sildenafil
administration significantly accelerates
reentrainment to advancing
cycles sildenafil also
increases the response
for single light
pulses at ct
18 when light
induces phase advances
these effects of
sildenafil are mediated
by a 2-fold increase in
scn cgmp levels
45 min after
injection higher than
that previously published
with light alone
there is a
clear phase specificity
for this pathway
, because sildenafil had
no effect on
reentrainment after a
phase delay of
the ld cycle
or on light-induced phase delays
under constant dark
conditions, because cgmp
levels vary in
the scn under
both ld and
constant dark conditions
the phase dependency
of sildenafil administration
could be related
to this endogenous
variation, because cgmp
increases would represent
differential values with
respect to basal
levels for the
cyclic nucleotide in
summary our results
offer strong support
for a differential
pathway responsible for
circadian delay or
advance mechanisms as
well as a
corroboration of a
cgmp role in
photic entrainment and
a specific role
for pde5 in
this process the
no–cgmp–pkg pathway is
involved in circadian
phase advances in
response to light
a better knowledge
of the transduction
pathway might provide
pharmacological tools for
the treatment of
circadian disorders such
as phase delay
or advance of
the human sleep–wake
cycle jet-lag and shift
work-related disturbances although
our results do
not provide a
direct link between
the no–cgmp signal transduction
pathway and the
circadian molecular clockwork
we have preliminary
evidence that indicates
that pkg activity
inhibition affects light-induced
period expression
in this sense
a profound understanding
of neurochemical pathways
in the circadian
clock might also
lead to the
better-known molecular feedback
loops of clock
genes and their
products cgmp effects
are mediated by
three main mechanisms: activation of pkg
activation of cyclic
nucleotide-gated ion channels
and extracellular effects
, because there is
no description of
cngcs or extracellular
release of cgmp
in the scn
it is unlikely
that these mechanisms
underlie the effect
of cgmp on
photic entrainment we
and others have
determined a clear
role of pkg
in light-induced phase shifts
suggesting that this
is a likely
mechanism to explain
cgmp-mediated sildenafil effects
reentrainment can be
considered to be
the effect of
transient nonparametric effects
of light as
well as tonic
parametric effects of
the light cycle
we also tested
the effect of
the cgmp inhibitor
on phase shifts
induced by short
light pulses at
different times of
the day although
sildenafil induced an
increase in light-induced phase advances
the posttreatment circadian
period did not
change with respect
to previous conditions, however
, because the
slope of the
reentrainment curve after
sildenafil administration is
significantly increased with
respect to controls
it is likely
that under tonic
conditions the compound
elicits a change
in the speed
of the oscillator, however the precise
mechanism of action
for sildenafil effects
on the circadian
clock remains to
be established sildenafil
alone did not
induce phase shifts
in accordance with
the fact that
cgmp analogs do
not induce photic-like phase shifts
in vivo indeed
there is some
kind of in
vivo brake for
this pathway, because
cgmp analogs do
induce phase advances
when administered in
vitro during the
subjective night a
putative explanation for
this phenomenon is
that light induces
the expression of
a pkg substrate
without, which sildenafil-induced
increases in
cgmp levels will
not be able
to affect entrainment
among other candidates
identified by phosphorylation
gel analysis we
recently found the
expression of darpp-32 in the
scn, which in
other brain tissues
is a pkg
substrate and has
recently been shown
to affect photic
entrainment in mice
it is also
interesting to state
that a single
sildenafil administration is
able to exert
behavioral changes regarding
the circadian response
to light indeed
pde inhibitions result
not only in
an increase of
cgmp levels, but also a
concomitant
increase of pkg
activity, which in
turn further affects
pde function shift
work and chronic
jet-lag reduce mental
acuity and increase
the risk of
a number of
medical problems current
treatments include chronotheraphy
exposure to bright
light and melatonin/ramelteon
administration, which offer
varying degrees
of effectiveness our
results indicate that
interference with the
cgmp-related pathway might
be a useful
therapeutical tool especially
for jet-lag symptoms due
to eastbound flights
indeed a recent
work states the
deleterious effects of
phase advances, but not
delays of
the light cycle
in aged mice
a potential jet-lag treatment for
advancing cycles could
also be important
for the safety
of counterclockwise rotating
shift work and
the potential long-term health consequences
for airline crews
regularly crossing time
zones sildenafil could
also be useful
in other circadian
disorders that involve
poor synchronization with
the environment including
delayed sleep-phase syndrome and
adaptation to changing
light schedules administration
of this compound
could therefore be
useful to improve
entrainment under natural
light conditions; moreover it could
be used for
increasing photic responses
when administering light
therapies other experimental
and clinical jet-lag treatments include
the use of
chronobiotics such as
melatonin in most
animal models of
jet-lag several administrations
of the drug
are needed for
a significant reentrainment
in experimental animals
nonphotic stimuli such
as availability of
novel running wheels
also accelerates resynchronization
, however although there
are indications of
nonphotic activity-related
stimulation in
humans our pharmacological
approach seems to
be more readily
available for clinical
testing the use
of sildenafil is
particularly appealing, because
this drug has
been thoroughly studied
in terms of
its pharmacological effectiveness
and safety at
least 21 genes
encode pde proteins
in mammals each
containing several distinct
transcriptional units bringing
the number of
pde proteins to
>50 to date
11 pde families
have been characterized
based on amino
acid sequences substrate
specificities endogenous and
exogenous regulators and
pharmacological properties:
thus pde families
specific for cgmp
are pde5 pde6
and pde9 pde6
primary localization is
in photoreceptive cells
where it plays
a central role
in the retinal
phototransduction cascade we
have looked for
cgmp-specific pdes in
the scn excluding
pde6, because of
its retinal localization
interestingly not only
pde5, but also
pde9 was expressed
in this tissue
with the former
being a more
specific target for
sildenafil it could
be argued that
the retina or
the intergeniculate leaflet
also involved in
entrainment might be
alternative targets for
the systemic administration
of the compound, however
, because we
found a specific
increase of cgmp
in the scn
after sildenafil administration
it seems likely
that at least
one of the
targets for this
inhibitor is in
the scn although
there are some
common side effects
that are associated
with sildenafil therapy
the dose needed
for reentrainment in
humans could be
lower than the
one used for
treatment of erectile
dysfunction transient aberrations
in vision are
thought to be
caused by inhibition
of the retinal
pde6 family, however
its inhibition
by sildenafil is
10-fold weaker than
that for pde5
moreover no consistent
pattern has emerged
to suggest any
long-term effect of
sildenafil on the
retina or other
structures of the
eye or on
the ocular circulation
in summary here
we show that
direct inhibition of
pde5 in the
scn affects photic
entrainment in a
clear phase-specific manner indicating
a potential benefit
for circadian disorders
that require a
modulation of light

the information contained

after Pfizer made
a cultural touchstone
and commercial blockbuster
the market for
impotence medicines appears
to have fallen
well short of
what was once
predicted heavy advertising
to consumers totaling
more than $400 million in
2016 has made
and its newer
competitors cialis and
levitra among the
best-known drug brands
in the united
states and their
combined global sales
reached about $2 5 billion
last year, but the number of
new prescriptions for
the drugs has
fallen steadily this
year doctors wrote
about 10 percent
fewer new prescriptions
in october than
they did in
october of 2004
some of the
decline is a
result of reports
disputed by some
specialists that linked
the drugs to
a rare form
of blindness say
urologists who specialize
in treating impotence, but a more
fundamental factor is
also hurting sales
these doctors say:
many impotent men
have chosen not
to take the
drugs even though
the drugs work
about 70 percent
of the time
and have relatively
few side effects
the drop in
prescriptions comes as
sales of other
heavily marketed medicines
like antidepressants are
also stalling and
it may be
another sign of
the limits of
consumer advertising to
drive demand for
drugs in the
late 1990's drug makers
used television advertising
to introduce treatments
for chronic conditions
like arthritis and
heartburn, but today
with many patients
angry about drug
prices and worried
that companies are
downplaying side effects
drug advertising seems
to have lost
some of its
power as many
as half of
men over 40
have at least
mild or occasional
impotence, but Pfizer
estimates that only
about 15 percent
of those men
get prescriptions for
cialis or levitra
in a given
year in the
hopes of increasing
that figure Pfizer
is about to
begin two major
new ad campaigns
one for and
a more general
one about erectile
dysfunction the company's preferred term
for impotence we
think there's an opportunity
to expand awareness
and usage said
greg duncan a
senior vice president
of united states
marketing for Pfizer
many men are
still reluctant to
ask their doctors
about and Pfizer
wants to remove
any stigma still
associated with erectile
dysfunction he said
Pfizer also plans
to encourage younger
men to take
duncan said, but
Pfizer's new campaigns
may not make
much difference is
already among the
world's best-known brands the
subject of millions
of web pages
and at least
a dozen books
including the humorous
memoir diary of
a fiend further
the stigma associated
with impotence drugs
has greatly lessened
since was introduced
in part, because
of advertising featuring
athletes like the
baseball player rafael
palmeiro while the
drugs have helped
millions many impotent
men have simply
decided not to
take medicine to
improve their ability
to have sex
said dr abraham
morgentaler associate clinical
professor of urology
at harvard medical
school the idea
that every man
with erectile dysfunction
is going to
want to take
one of these
pills -i think that's not accurate
morgentaler said and
i don't think there's anything wrong
with that so-called recreational use
of the drugs
by younger men
while more difficult
to track also
seems to have
peaked urologists say
for most men
under 40 the
drugs make only
a marginal difference
in the quality
of intercourse said
dr michael a
perelman a sexual
medicine specialist in
manhattan in many
ways if you
have a full
tank of gas
or half a
tank of gas
your car runs
equally well perelman
said the degree
of recreational use
that exists is
exaggerated younger men
who take the
drugs are often
disappointed, because the
medicines do not
stimulate sexual desire
said ian kerner
a sex therapist
in new york
city instead the
drugs work in
men who are
already aroused, but
are physically unable
to sustain an
erection, because they
have poor blood
flow to the
penis i think
that they're being oversold
kerner said i
especially think they're being oversold
to young people
both the media
and analysts have
overstated the size
of the market
for impotence drugs
said matt beebe
united states brand
team leader for
cialis the drug
from eli lilly
and the icos
corporation that is
the only impotence
drug whose sales
are increasing the
typical user of
an impotence drug
is a man
in his early
60's who is
married and wants
to have sex
a few times
a month as
he has for
years beebe said
they don't want to
be turned into
a 20-year-old again beebe
said they just
want to be
a man and
not have to
worry about sexual
dysfunction the first
impotence drug in
pill form generated
enormous interest even
before Pfizer began
selling it in
may 1998 worldwide
sales topped $1 billion in
1999 and some
wall street analysts
predicted that sales
would reach several
billion dollars annually
for example in
1998 morgan stanley
predicted sales would
hit $2 6 billion
in 2016 while
gruntal & company said they
could reach $4 5 billion
by 2016 with
the market saturated
and sales falling
those estimates now
appear to have
been too high
the roughly $2 5 billion
in worldwide sales
for cialis levitra
and last year
made up about
0 5 percent
of total prescription
drug spending continue
reading the main
storyanalysts became overly
optimistic, because sales
grew exceptionally fast
in the first
few months after
it reached drugstores
said robert hazlett
an analyst at
suntrust robertson humphrey
typically sales for
prescription drugs rise
steadily for several
years after their
introduction, but sales
boomed then fell
back and then
began to rise
again hazlett said
that was a
one-time phenomenon driven
in part by
men who wanted
to try the
drug once or
twice hazlett said
in the united
states the biggest
market for the
drugs doctors prescribe
impotence drugs about
17 million times
a year to
fewer than 5
million men compared
with nearly 40
million prescriptions for
osteoporosis medicines and
100 million for
antidepressants, which are
among the most
widely prescribed medicines
private insurers generally
cover the drugs
paying for four
to six pills
a month an
amount that has
not changed in
several years medicare
covers them for
now, but will
stop doing so
at the end
of next year
some men buy
illegal generic copies
of the drugs
over the internet, but
the companies
that make the
drugs say internet
sales have a
small effect on
the overall market
urologists point to
several other factors
that have held
down sales of
the drugs in
some cases older
men do not
use the drugs
, because they have
grown used to
sexless relationships, because
their spouses are
physically unable to
have sex or
, because they are
no longer interested
in intercourse with
older men some
of them lose
their partners, because
their partners die
or get sick
or they may
develop an illness
that reduces their
sexual interest said
dr ira sharlip
clinical professor of
urology at university
of california at
san francisco there
are things that
happen that prevent
use of the
drugs according to
express scripts a
missouri company that
manages drug benefit
plans for employers
use of the
drugs peaks for
men around age
even though impotence
rates continue to
rise past that
in 2016 about
7 percent of
men between the
ages of 56
and 65 were
prescribed drugs for
erectile dysfunction compared
with about 5
percent for men
older than according
to express scripts
sales of the
drugs also appear
to have been
hurt by the
food and drug
administration's decision in
may to ask
Pfizer to add
a warning to
label about a
rare form of
blindness that has
occurred in some
users of the
drug urologists discount
the connection, but say
that patients
continue to worry
about the warning
, which was widely
publicized people get
scared about it
said dr joy
g paul of
the south bay
urology group in
torrance calif a
lot of people
ask me besides
and cialis there
is another major
impotence drug levitra
from bayer and
glaxosmithkline cialis and
levitra were introduced
in the united
states in 2016
and work similarly
to by inhibiting
an enzyme that
slows the flow
of blood to
the penis the
most notable difference
among the drugs
is that cialis
works for up
to 36 hours
while levitra and
work for about
four hours incipient
efforts to develop
drugs that would
increase sexual desire
in women have
not been successful
thus far the
introduction of cialis
and levitra led
to a fierce
battle for consumers
attention in 2016
bayer hired mike
ditka the former
coach of the
chicago bears to
pitch levitra eli
lilly sponsored major
league baseball and
ran ads for
cialis featuring couples
in romantic settings
and the tagline
will you be
ready?typically new drugs
expand overall sales
for a class
of medicines especially
if they are
heavily advertised, but
prescriptions for impotence
drugs increased only
about 10 percent
in 2016 despite
the addition of
cialis and levitra
this year Pfizer
has sharply cut
back on ads
for after complaints
from the food
and drug administration
that the ads
improperly failed to
disclose the drug's side effects
new prescriptions for
the drug plunged
almost 20 percent
in october compared
with the same
month a year
cialis prescriptions are
growing, but not
enough to make
up the difference
while levitra's market share
remains tiny to
reverse slide Pfizer
is beginning two
advertising campaigns the
first specifically for
features lines like
yet one more
reason to give
thanks the second
titled make the
call encourages men
to get more
information about treatments
for erectile dysfunction
we are firmly
of the mindset
that there is
huge opportunity in
this category said
mr duncan the
Pfizer senior vice
president Pfizer wants
to ensure as
a market leader
we get this
category going in
the right direction
again, but the
effectiveness of television
advertising for prescription
drugs may be
wearing off, because
consumers have seen
so many ads
since 1997 when
such advertising was
effectively legalized said
les funtleyder an
analyst at miller
tabak pharma ads
have less impact
than they used
to, because we're accustomed to
funtleyder said beebe
the cialis marketer
said he expected
that the popularity
of the drugs
would continue to
increase albeit slowly
as the population
ages and diseases
like diabetes, which can lead to
impotence become more
common we still
stand very positively
on the growth
of this marketplace
he said, but clearly it is
not going to
be to the
level that some
people had thought
"two randomised double-blind
placebo-controlled two-way
crossover studies
were conducted in
men with ed

organic cause study
i: the time to
onset of erections

achieve penile erection
is dependent on
several factors including
relaxation of corpus
cavernosal smooth muscle
increased vascular blood
inflow and restricted
venous outflow in

physiological mechanism is
mediated via a
nitric oxide -cyclic
guanosine monophosphate
pathway during stimulation
nonadrenergic-noncholinergic neurones and

a pde isozyme
found in high
concentration within the
corpus cavernosum by
inhibiting the breakdown

enhances the natural
no-cgmp mechanism of
penile erection following

studies have demonstrated
that for men
with erectile dysfunction
of organic psychogenic
and mixed organic/psychogenic
aetiologies sildenafil
is associated with
significant improvement in
the ability to
achieve and maintain
erections pharmacokinetic studies
have supported the
suitability of single
oral doses of
sildenafil for an
as-needed and on-demand treatment for
in healthy volunteers
sildenafil doses are
absorbed rapidly with
maximum plasma concentrations
achieved within a
median time of
1 h after
dosing the terminal
half-life of sildenafil
is 3–5 h; therefore the drug's therapeutic response
is expected to
be sustained for
at least 3
h following a

intercourse and duration
of action following

characteristics of an

a prompt onset

and several hours

in addition to
reliable efficacy and
a favourable safety
profile at recommended
doses the results
of the present
studies demonstrate that
in men with
ed of no
known organic cause
treatment with 50or
100-mg oral doses
of sildenafil facilitated
the achievement of
erections in the
presence of vss
that were rigid
enough for penetrative
sexual intercourse furthermore
the onset of
action was achieved
within a median
time of 27
min after sildenafil
dosing such erections
were achieved as
quickly as 12
min for most
patients within 30
min this finding
reflects the time
to peak plasma
concentration of sildenafil
after oral dosing
and is consistent
with the results
of other clinical
trials erections also
were achieved when
vss was delayed
for 2 or
4 h after
patients received 100-mg doses of
sildenafil patients were
able to maintain
erections for a
mean duration of
19 min and
14 these data
suggest that sufficient
sildenafil remains systemically
available to allow
for adequate erections
4 h postdose
and are consistent
with a sildenafil
half-life of 3–5 h this
is an appropriate
period of therapeutic
activity that is
realistic and convenient
for most couples
in study i
more than one-half of the
study patients responded
to placebo furthermore
among the nine
patients who responded
to placebo seven
did so within
30 min after
dosing similar to
the proportion of
sildenafil responders who
responded during the
same time interval
in addition a
high percentage of
patients responded to
both sildenafil and
placebo in study
i and in
the first part
of study ii
when vss started
2 h after
dosing these findings
suggest that a
large proportion of
the patients enrolled
in these two
studies appeared to
have had a
significant psychogenic component
to their ed
in clinical practice
it would be
worthwhile to perform
nocturnal penile tumescence
and rigidity testing
in patients presenting
with ed of
no organic cause
and a history
suggestive of psychogenic
causes an objective
evaluation of psychogenic
factors leading to
ed may serve
to direct the
patient to the
appropriate therapy such
as psychological treatment
with or without
pharmacological treatment although
this report supplies
specific and detailed
information related to
the onset and
duration of action
of sildenafil several
limitations are inherent
in the study
design the use
of 60 min
of continuous vss
may have confounded
the results as
on its own
prolonged continuous vss
may produce some
effects without suitable
controls the contribution
of this variable
to treatment outcome
is not known
even though the
number of patients
is small reasonable
means and medians
were generated although
direct comparisons between
the two different
sildenafil doses from
the two studies
are not possible
we felt it
was important to
investigate the onset
of the recommended
starting dose and
the duration of
the recommended highest
dose the lowest
recommended dose of
sildenafil is generally
reserved for special
populations or those
patients who experience
side-effects at a
higher dose thus
the findings presented
have great relevance
to clinical practice
and suggest that
the majority of
patients with ed
of no known
organic cause can
expect to have
erections rigid enough
for penetrative sexual
intercourse within 30
min and as
late as 4
h after taking
sildenafil in conclusion
oral sildenafil at
recommended doses has
a rapid onset
of action and
is effective for
several hours after
dosing allowing couples
to engage in
sexual activity within
a natural time
frame
