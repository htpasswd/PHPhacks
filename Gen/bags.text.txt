a gift or
a present is
an item given
to someone without
the expectation of
payment an item
is not a
gift if that
item itself is
already owned by
the one to
whom it is
given although gift-giving might involve
an expectation of
reciprocity a gift
is meant to
be free in
many countries the
act of mutually
exchanging money goods
etc may sustain
social relations and
contribute to social
cohesion economists have
elaborated the economics
of gift-giving into the
notion of a
gift economy by
extension the term
gift can refer
to anything that
makes the other
happier or less
sad especially as
a favor including
forgiveness and kindness
gifts are also
first and foremost
presented on occasions
- birthdays and in
western cultures christmas
being the main
examples in many
cultures gifts are
traditionally packaged in
some way for
example in western
often wrapped in
wrapping paper and
accompanied by a
gift note which
may note the
occasion the recipient's name and
the giver's name in
chinese culture red
wrapping connotes luck
although inexpensive gifts
are common among
colleagues associates and
acquaintances expensive or
intimate gifts are
considered more appropriate
among close friends
romantic interests or
relatives at common
law for a
gift to have
legal effect it
was required that
there be intent
by the donor
to give a
gift and delivery
to the recipient
of the item
to be given
as a gift
in some countries
certain types of
gifts above a
certain monetary amount
are subject to
taxation for the
united states see
gift tax in
the united states
in some contexts
gift giving can
be construed as
bribery this tends
to occur in
situations where the
gift is given
with an implicit
or explicit agreement
between the giver
of the gift
and its receiver
that some type
of service will
be rendered because
some groups such
as government workers
may have strict
rules concerning gift
giving and receiving
so as to
avoid the appearance
of impropriety the
anxiety attached to
gift giving is
worth considering the
christian commemoration of
christmas is about
celebrating god's ultimate gift
his only son
such an exceptional
gift reaches its
destiny in the
crucifixion of jesus: a sacrifice that
can never be
acquitted the extraordinary
nature of this
gift which ends
in death is
resonant of a
debt economy capitalism
is sustained through
a debt economy
of profits and
arrears that spin
endlessly in keeping
the many beholden
and the few
prosperous during the
festive season it
is clear that
the sacred and
the secular share
an unholy alliance
through their generation
of a gift
economy that leads
to indebtedness if
we think of
christ as a
gift the opportunity
for reimbursement is
slight mortals cannot
match the divine
offering only revere
and give thanks
to it the
secular gift also
poses problems for
we are inclined
through politeness to
return in equal
measure the kind
of generosity shown
to us this
brings to mind
søren kierkegaard's insightful claim
in fear and
trembling that it
is far more
difficult to receive
than to give
one might wonder
then if the
true gift exists? that is a
gift which does
not make us
feel indebted beholden
or dare I
say even guilty? perhaps a better
way of approaching
this question is
to consider the
great work of
philanthropic charities – both religious and
otherwise – that try to
address social and
economic inequality certainly
spending both one's time and
money with friends
and family over
the festive season
should give us
pause to think
of those who
do not have
these things other
kinds of altruistic
gifts include anonymous
donations as well
as the very
personal act of
organ donation these
sorts of gifts
are certainly worthy
of our praise
as they fall
within the realm
of what is
virtuous and ethical
but do they
succeed in cancelling
our sense of
indebtedness? such humanitarian examples
do not address
the heightened commercial
activity that begins
months before december
25 and which
reaches its climax
in the january
sales perhaps the
annual january sales
give prudent shoppers
the opportunity to
give to themselves
– something which has
become a consumer
ritual over the
years does this
version of the
post-christmas gift eradicate
indebtedness? certainly the guilt
of consumption is
assuaged by the
notion of acquiring
a bargain during
there is also
a conflict and
collision between the
secular and the
sacred for those
more spiritually minded
it is a
time for quiet
reflection for others
trying to eke
out a retail
existence it is
an important period
of debt recovery
this tension and
anxiety over material
and immaterial gifts
has also been
the source and
subject of influential
christmas narratives take
charles dickens's famous morality
tale a christmas
carol in which
the miserly old
scrooge learns to
change his ways
by the intervention
of benign ghosts
who show him
the fruits of
his meanness in
this story the
spirit of christmas
is about being
kindly and generous
so that one
in turn receives
benevolence in fact
there are innumerable
christmas fables that
provide variations on
this theme another
classic example is
frank capra's film it's a wonderful
life where the
hero of the
tale played by
jimmy stewart contemplates
suicide on christmas
eve only to
reverse his decision
by a benevolent
angel once he
is made aware
of how much
his life has
made others happy
both of these
narratives carry the
christian messages of
showing others goodwill
kindness and compassion
the kind of
generosity dramatised in
each tale may
not revolve around
the exchange of
material goods but
nonetheless the significance
of the monetary
offering cannot be
understated this is
particularly important to
jimmy stewart's character george
bailey whose bankruptcy
is the cause
of suicidal thoughts
this is exacerbated
by his belief
that his life
insurance policy will
at least save
his family on
the other hand
dickens' scrooge plays a
shrewd capitalist who
initially values money
over family and
friends only to
realise the incalculable
pleasure of being
kind to others
bailey and scrooge
come from opposite
ends of the
gift-giving spectrum but
in the end
each learns through
the agency of
a celestial messenger
how important it
is to be
able to both
give and receive
it's a wonderful
life was capra's personal favourite
film and like
dickens' influential story it
is often broadcast
at christmas time
in both narratives
each protagonist learns
an important lesson
yet however morally
commendable and valuable
these messages are
the real-life problems of
abject poverty cannot
be ignored these
christmas fictions and
many others like
them may provide
us with pleasing
conclusions where the
good are rewarded
and the bad
see the error
in their ways
yet the fact
remains that capitalism's debt economy
means that most
of us will
always be duty-bound the promise
then of the
pure gift that
asks for nothing
in return and
which releases us
from the anxiety
of obligation remains
an ideal yet
to be realised
in the world
jacques t godbout
and alain caillé
discuss the importance
of gifts in
have primarily stressed
that despite their
economic significance gifts
are primarily of
social moral and
emotional worth they
oppose the view
that the concept
is no longer
of value instead they argue
that charity is
a form of
gift and is
increasing with the
passage of time
in most of
the industrialized world
in this way
they have elaborated
the gift as
a social bond
even in the
present day societies
substantiating their views
through valid examples
while debating other
views in the
literature in fourteen
chapters of this
book godbout and
caille have presented
the history of
the gift from
ancient to the
modern societies and
discussed its forms
in different cultural
settings -- not only the
archaic notions of
gift like potlatch
and kula but
volunteer works organ
donations and the
relationship between artists
and society are
also forms prevailing
today -- all have moral
and social significance
they are convinced
of the role
of gift in
the social integration
beyond the material
value of the
object and say: we have however
gradually come to
believe that the
gift is just
as typical of
modern and contemporary
societies as it
is typical of
archaic one that it does
not only isolated
and discontinuous incidents
in social life
but social life
in its entirety
today still nothing
can be initiated
or undertaken can
thrive or function
if it is
not nourished by
the gift they
reject the idea
that societies survive
on market exchange
and that self-interest dominates the
human world gifting
as an important
element of social
connections creates a
moral sense associating
the members not
necessarily for economic
reciprocity but more
for emotional ties
and strengthens social
relations for instance
they note how
family inheritance continues
over generations as
an un-reciprocal form of
gift the book
concludes to say
that the world
functions through inter-personal
and inter-group obligations in
the form of
gifts through which
society seeks to
survive so the
book is worth
reading not only
by economic anthropologists
or other social
science researchers who
want to debate
formal and substantive
approaches towards economics
but also by
anyone wishing to
understand how the
world works in
a socialized way
bundling a big
generous present with
a little extra
stocking stuffer actually
detracts from the
appreciation of your
big gift contrary
to everything we've been taught
receivers feel closer
to you afterward
if you choose
a gift that
reflects your interests
rather than theirs
if you're in a
romantic relationship or
hoping to nurture
one you need
to be more
careful giving a
present to a
man than a
woman these are
some of the
findings from psychologists
and other researchers
who study gift-giving that you
may want to
take into account
this holiday season
marilyn cohen an
art and design
historian who teaches
at parsons school
of design in
new york is
a lover of
popular culture and
has a distinctive
fashion style: she mixes vintage
clothing with target
fine antique jewelry
with pieces made
from plastic buttons
even to some
friends who dress
simply and conservatively
this season she
is giving earrings
made from miniaturized
vintage greeting cards
a friend who
loves florida is
getting ones that
say greetings from
florida I wouldn't give something
there was no
possibility they would
use but maybe
it will be
like a souvenir
of their friend
and they'll value it
for that reason
dr cohen says
research suggests she's doing something
right psychologists asked
participants in a
series of studies
to report how
close they felt
to each other
before and after
exchanging gifts in
one study of
122 university students
for example some
givers were instructed
to give an
itunes song that
reflects your true
self and others
to give one
that reflects your
knowledge of the
recipient surprisingly concluded
the authors of
the paper published
in september in
the journal of
experimental social psychology
in the studies
overall both givers
and receivers report
greater feelings of
closeness to their
gift partner when
the gift reflects
the giver lara
aknin assistant professor
of social psychology
at simon fraser
university in british
columbia was one
of the researchers
and takes her
findings to heart
she recently gave
her brother josh
a gift card
to one of
her favorite french
restaurants for his
birthday even though
he typically eats
at casual places
like the cheesecake
factory or the
keg i'll have steak
frites she recommends
it he says
i'm very excited
and i'll think of
her how often
do you give
someone a big
generous gift and
add on a
small extra for
fun? it turns out
the little stocking
stuffer is actually
detracting from appreciation
overall in a
series of seven
experiments researchers discovered
that recipients subconsciously
average the values
of the individual
components when forming
an impression of
the bundle overall
says kimberlee weaver
associate professor of
marketing at virginia
tech so they
value your present
less if you
bundle something big
with several little
things for the
paper published in
consumer research in
2012 the researchers
tested bundles of
various kinds from
music to scholarship
packages in one
experiment with 54
consumers for example
participants said they
were willing to
pay $242 for an
ipod touch mp3
player they would
pay only $177 for the
same ipod touch
with one free
music download included
when givers bundle
together a larger
item like a
le creuset dutch
oven with some
smaller items like
a spatula or
potholders the research
shows dr weaver
says the more-is-better strategy backfires
a bad gift
makes men feel
less similar to
you according to
a 2008 paper
in the journal
social cognition researchers
tested couples' reactions to gifts
they thought their
partners chose looking
at male-female pairs who
were new acquaintances
or in dating
relationships among the
findings: women's outlook on
the relationship's future was
impervious to receiving
a bad versus
good gift authors
elizabeth dunn professor
of psychology at
university of british
columbia and colleagues
state but men
reported feeling significantly
less similar when
they received a
disappointing gift and
the reduction in
perceived similarity affected
their evaluation of
the relationship's future potential
when choosing presents
for men dr
dunn advises that
you think about
how you're similar and
choose a gift
that builds on
that area of
similarity if you
don't share much
but skiing go
for the skiing-related gift she
says she and
her husband love
biking her last
gift to him
was a bright
orange mountain bike
he loved it
givers overestimate how
much recipients will
appreciate a charitable
donation in their
name according to
an august paper
organizational behavior and
human decision processes
in one study
of 245 participants
gift givers were
instructed to choose
one of six
gifts to give
someone they knew
three of the
options were a
basic travel mug
an executive-style ballpoint pen
or a usb
flash drive the
others were donations
to charities givers
chose charitable donations
40% of the time
most recipients however
would have preferred
even a really
mundane tangible gift
such as a
travel mug says
lisa cavanaugh assistant
professor of marketing
at university of
southern california's marshall school
of business and
one of the
authors recipients think
it says more
about you than
about your commitment
to them one
spouse actually said
‘it showed me
he cared about
the world but
he didn't care about
me dr cavanaugh says
distant friends and
spouses were the
ones who didn't appreciate the
charitable donations researchers
found close friends
didn't object and
parents liked getting
these gifts from
their children if
you want to
give a gift
of charity it
might be safer
to choose a
gift card from
an organization that
allows recipients to
pick which charity
will get the
funds and because
they picked it
perhaps feel some
of the warm
glow of charitable
giving themselves toddlers
exhibited greater happiness
when giving treats
to others than
receiving them according
to an analysis
of the facial
expressions of 20
toddlers in a
2012 study by
dr aknin dr
dunn and kiley
hamlin of university
of british columbia
dr aknin and
colleagues reported in
experimental psychology in
august that the
same was true
for children in
an isolated village
in the south
pacific without electricity
or running water
people are happier
spending money on
others than themselves
she says the
research grew out
of a 2008
paper in the
journal science that
dr dunn dr
aknin and michael
norton of harvard
business school co-authored they asked
16 adults to
rate their general
feeling of happiness
on a scale
bonus at work
and to report
how much of
the bonus they
spent on themselves
gifts and charity
spending on gifts
and charity was
a better predictor
of their happiness
than the size
of the bonus
the researchers found
it's that time
of the year
when people's attention is
focused on the
holiday ritual of
gift-giving shoppers are
scurrying about looking
for the right
gift for the
special people in
their lives gift
exchange is a
major part of
celebrating the holidays
but did you
know the whole
act of gift-giving can offer
psychological benefits? giving a gift
is a universal
way to show
interest appreciation and
gratitude as well
as strengthen bonds
with others sources
say there is
the whole act
— determining what needs
and making sure
it fits with
the person says
devin a byrd
ph d associate
professor and chair
of the department
of behavioral sciences
at south university
— savannah there is
an emotional lift
when searching for
the gift better
to give than
to receive gift-giving is also
an act of
altruism — unselfish concern for
the well-being of others
when we give
without expecting anything
in return we
are improving our
psychological health in
lifespan and developmental
psychology we teach
about altruism and
how it benefits
individuals and society
says dr darlene
silvernail owner of
silvernail consultant services
and psychology instructor
— west palm beach
gift-giving feels good
internally and there
are extrinsic benefits
also there is
an enormous sense
of satisfaction when
seeing the expression
on the face
of someone you've given a
gift to a
way to express
feelings giving reinforces
appreciation and acknowledgement
of each other
the feelings expressed
mainly depend on
the relationship between
giver and recipient
also if it
is friend to
friend people will
remain thoughtful byrd
says if it
is a romantic
relationship people will
try to go
for sentiment as
well taps into
how we want
to connect with
that individual he
says gift-giving is also
a way for
the giver to
reduce guilt that
really comes into
play when you
have people giving
from afar he
says now it
is a lot
easier to order
a gift online
and send it
it can be
a replacement for
not being there
with the person
they gain satisfaction
when they find
the right gift
and that brings
emotional happiness if
you do something
positive positive psychology
says you attract
positive silvernail says
people don't always give
just to get
something back but
many times we
think ‘if I do
a good deed
something good will
happen for me
' gift giving the
expectation of reciprocity
often comes with
gift-giving byrd says
i imagine that
there is a
small subset of
us who do
give and expect
nothing in return
you can tag
that with those
who give anonymously
he says but
i think there
is an innate
desire to receive
no matter the
gift people want
to receive psychologists
aren't the only
ones who understand
the mental and
emotional benefits of
gift-giving the holiday
season is also
a big time
for advertisers to
tap into the
feelings of consumers
in an effort
to get them
to buy products
it seems as
if christmas advertising
arrives earlier every
year whether it's through television
commercials and shopping
websites filled with
holiday music and
graphics or store
displays offering festive
cheer consumers can't escape holiday
advertising advertisers are
very good at
creating a culture
of giving and
being prepared for
finding that right
gift byrd says
great expectation and
buildup of what
it will mean
when a person
receives it advertisers
also know about
the satisfaction of
the deal — something that looks
like an expensive
gift but the
person purchased it
for a deal
gifts can also
bring on feelings
of negativity for
both the giver
and recipient when
the gift is
much more or
much less than
they expected a
person can have
immediate feelings of
resentment if they
feel a person
has not spent
enough byrd says
they feel undervalued
or cheated or
perhaps the gift
expresses more feelings
than expected although
gift-giving can be
a de-stressor and create
balance the hunt
for the perfect
gift for friends
and family can
also cause a
lot of stress
the costs of
gifts and what
it takes to
package them can
be a financial
burden people need
to remember there
are ways to
acknowledge others without
having to purchase
something byrd says
christmas cards and
photos tell you
that you are
in that person's network and
you are important
enough to keep
updated with what's going on
in that person's life activities
such as gatherings
or parties are
also a good
way to share
the holiday spirit
without exchanging gifts
i think the
focus should stay
on what the
holidays are really
about and not
on the commercial
aspects of it
silvernail says gifts
don't have to
be huge monetary

everyone feel good

in the gift: imagination and the
erotic life of
property lewis hyde
uses anthropology economics
psychology art and
fairy tales to
examine the role
gifts have played
and continue to
play in our
emotional and spiritual
life by gifts
hyde means both
material objects and
immaterial talents and
inspirations such as
'a gift for
music or a gift for
mathematics or as
hyde himself so
lyrically observes I
have hoped to
speak of the
inner gift that
we accept as
the object of
our labor and
the outer gift
that has become
a vehicle of
culture I am
not concerned with
gifts given in
spite or fear
nor those gifts
we accept out
of servility or
obligation my concern is
the gift we
long for the
gift that when
it comes speaks
commandingly to the
soul and irresistibly
moves us above
all hyde is
interested in examining
the effect our
current immersion in
the market economy
and the myth
of the free
market has both
on our view
of gifts and
on our ability
to give and
receive them the
market economy is
deliberately impersonal but
the whole purpose
of the gift economy is
to establish and
strengthen the relationships
between us to
connect us one
to the other
it is this
element of relationship
which leads to
speak of gift
exchange as erotic commerce opposing
eros to logos
a market economy
is an emanation
of logos in
one can hoard
one's goods without
losing wealth indeed
wealth is increased
by hoarding although
we generally call
it saving in contrast in
a gift economy
wealth is decreased
by hoarding for
it is the
circulation of the
gift within the
community that leads
to increase increase
in connections increase
in relationship strength
through this book
hyde helps us
focus on the
importance of gifts
their flow and
movement and the
impact that the
modern market place
has had on
the circulation of
gifts in the
first half of
the book hyde
examines the structure
of traditional gift
economies for non-western cultures he
relies on anthropological
studies for western culture
he looks at
our fairy tales
and myths in
the second half
of the book
hyde looks at
the lives and
art of walt
whitman and ezra
pound two american
poets whose reaction
to their gifts
and the effects
of the market
economy on those
gifts were very
different whitman focused
his poetic gift
on giving expression
to the inarticulate
the erotic the
fecundity of nature
whitman did not
hold to material
ambitions he easily distinguished
between earning a
living and the
labor of art
the work of
my life is
making poems he
declared when leaves
of grass first
appeared whitman's riches were
founded in this
refusal to take
seriously things outside
his art in
contrast pound focused
on bringing order
to the forces
of fertility and
the erotic through
sheer strength of
will he was
incensed by the
barrenness of his
age by its
lack of generosity
towards art and
artists pound came
to obsess on
economics and the
unjust distribution of
wealth his obsession
was the death
of his art
hyde is deeply
interested in the
transformative gift: the gift that
changes us profoundly
often received in
psychological healing or
spiritual teachings an
important aspect of
a transformative gift
is that the
transformation is not
instantaneous it requires the
recipient to undertake
some extensive and
often difficult inner
work in order
to effect the
transformation completely what
motivates us to
undertake this labor? in general it
is a feeling
of love and
gratitude toward our
teacher or therapist
this can lead
to problems in
today's market economy
where healing and
teaching are frequently
sold rather than
freely given after
all even a
gifted teacher therapist
or spiritual guide
must eat! it is nonetheless
possible for an
element of the
gift economy to
circulate above the
cash I recall
some young parents
at our waldorf
school who although
barely scraping by
themselves managed to
come up each
year with the
full tuition for
their child when
asked why they
did not apply
for financial aid
for which they
certainly qualified they
looked surprised and
said the tuition
is our gift
to the teachers
for what they
are giving our
child if we
could afford more
we would certainly
give it as
an extreme example
of the opposite
approach the author
mentions the church
of scientology which
in 1979 had
a minimum initial
'donation of $2 700 for
a twelve-and-a-half intensive course
this kind of
exaggerated cost tends
to cut off
the forces of
love and gratitude
necessary for true
transformation the point
is that a
conversion in the
general sense cannot
be settled on
ahead of time
we can't predict the
fruits of our
labor we can't even know
if we'll really go
through with it
gratitude requires an
unpaid debt and
we will be
motivated to proceed
only so long
as the debt
is felt if
we stop feeling
indebted we quit
and rightly so
to sell a
transformative gift therefore
falsifies the relationship it implies that
the return gift
has been made
when in fact
it can't be made
until the transformation
is finished a
prepaid fee suspends
the weight of
the gift and
de-potentiates it as
an agent of
change therapies and
spiritual systems delivered
through the market
will therefore tend
to draw the
energy required for
conversion from an
aversion to pain
rather than from
an attraction to
a higher state
there is another
area of western
culture where a
remnant of the
old gift economy
is still active: the scientific community
in examining the
community of science
hyde begins by
noting that within
this community it
is the scientist
who shares ideas
with others who
gives away rather
than acquires who
receives the most
recognition and status
what then is
the effect on
science of treating
ideas as gifts
as contributions to
the community? hyde presents an
interesting case: the task of
science is to
describe and explain
the physical world
or more generally
to develop an
integrated body of
theory that can
account for the
facts and predict
them even such
a brief prospectus
points toward several
reasons why ideas
might be treated
as gifts the
first being that
the task of
assembling a mass
of disparate facts
into a coherent
whole clearly lies
beyond the powers
of a single
mind or even
a single generation
all such broad
intellectual undertakings call
for a community
of scholars one
in which each
individual thinker can
be awash in
the ideas of
his comrades so
that a sort
of group mind develops
one that is
capable of cognitive
tasks beyond the
powers of any
single person the
commerce of ideas
donated accepted integrated
constitutes the thinking
of such a
mind deas in physics
are discussed presented
at meetings tried
out and known
to the inner
circle of physicists
working in the
great centers long
before they are
published in papers
and books a
scientist may conduct
his research in
solitude but he
cannot do it
in isolation the
ends of science
require coordination each
individual's work must
'fit and the
synthetic nature of
gift exchange makes
it an appropriate
medium for this
integration it is not
just people that
must be brought
together but the
ideas themselves in
science as elsewhere
gifts produces and
maintains community whilst
the conversion of
gifts to commodities
fragments or destroys
that same community
however we are
now witnessing the
commodification of ideas
within the scientific
community universities and
industrial laboratories which
used to produce
basic research that
was released into
'the public domain
now patent and
otherwise protect their
research discoveries emerge
not as contributions
but as proprietary
ideas for which
users must pay
a fee a
usury this trend
began in the
late 1970's and early
1980's with biotechnology
but here and
now at the
end of the
millennium it seems
to have spread
to most fields
of scientific inquiry
how does the
group mind necessary
to produce theoretical
physics/chemistry/biology survive the
free-market?
traditionally academic freedom
refers to the
freedom of ideas it is the
perception that individuals
in the research
community must be
allowed fair use of
other researcher's ideas must
be allowed to
explore these ideas
without the payment
of a usury
but in a
free-market economy the
concepts of academic
freedom and fair
use are indentured
to the notion
of intellectual property
people may be
free but ideas
are most definitely
not lewis hyde
does not prescribe
answers to the
many questions his
book brings up
instead he encourages
us to challenge
our current assumptions
about the proper
role of the
market place in
our relationships with
each other and
our institutions the
louis vuitton label
was founded by
vuitton in 1854
on rue neuve
des capucines in
paris france louis
vuitton had observed
that the hj
cave osilite trunk
could be easily
stacked and in
1858 vuitton introduced
his flat-bottom trunks with
trianon canvas making
them lightweight and
airtight before the
introduction of vuitton's trunks 
rounded-top trunks were
used generally to
promote water run
off and thus
could not be
stacked it was
vuitton's gray trianon
canvas flat trunk
that allowed the
ability to stack
with ease for
voyages many other
luggagemakers imitated lv's style and
design the company
participated in the
1867 universal exhibition
in paris to
protect against the
duplication of his
look vuitton changed
the trianon design
to a beige
and brown stripes
design in 1876
by 1885 the
company opened its
first store in
london on oxford
street soon thereafter
due to the
continuing imitation of
his look in

pattern which bore
a logo that
reads marque l
vuitton déposée which
translates into l
vuitton registered trademark

later proved to
be successful in
stopping counterfeiting in

they are trying
to bury it
by pretending it
doesn't exist responding
to the book's release in
2004 a spokesman
for lvmh said: this is ancient
history the book
covers a period
when it was
family-run and long
before it became
part of lvmh
we are diverse
tolerant and all
the things a
modern company should
be an lvmh
spokesman told the
satirical magazine le
canard enchainé: we don't deny the
facts but regrettably
the author has
exaggerated the vichy

themselves then that
suits us fine
that publication was
the only french
periodical to mention
the book lvmh

at the end
of the 19th
century the gucci
company became one
of the world's most successful
manufacturers of high-end leather goods
clothing and other
fashion products as
an immigrant hotel
worker in paris
and later london
young guccio gucci
was impressed with
the luxurious luggage
he saw urbane
guests bring with
them before leaving
he visited the
manufacturer h j
cave & sons upon returning
to his birthplace
of florence a
city distinguished for
high-quality materials and
skilled artisans he
established a shop
in 1920 that
sold fine leather
goods with classic
styling although gucci
organized his workrooms
for industrial methods
of production he
maintained traditional aspects
of fabrication initially
gucci employed skilled
workers in basic
florentine leather crafts
attentive to finishing
with expansion machine
stitching was a
production method that
supported construction together
with three of
his sons aldo
gucci vasco gucci
and rodolfo gucci
gucci expanded the
company to include
stores in milan
and rome as
well as additional
shops in florence
gucci's stores featured
such finely crafted
leather accessories as
handbags shoes and
his iconic ornamented
loafer as well
as silks and
knitwear in a
signature pattern the
company made handbags
of cotton canvas
rather than leather
during world war
ii as a
result of material
shortages the canvas
however was distinguished
by a signature
double-g symbol combined
with prominent red
and green bands
after the war
the gucci crest
which showed a
shield and armored
knight surrounded by
a ribbon inscribed
with the family
name became synonymous
with the city
of florence aldo
further expanded the
company's horizons in
1953 by establishing
offices in new
york city film
stars and jet-set travelers to
italy during the
1950s and 1960s
brought their glamour
to florence turning

has lost the
rights to its

the uk to
a version of

in four categories
which encompassed garments

and coats german
clothing firm gerry

periods from 2003
through 2008 and
2007 through 2012
however according to
gucci the ruling
does not affect
the use of

in the region
because gucci is
the owner of
several other valid
registrations for this

community trade mark
for its iconic

gucci subcontractor in
italy told investigative
journalists that gucci
was aware it
irregularly employed chinese
workers who worked
as long as
14 hours a
day gucci is
famous for producing
controversial advertisements that
many believe sexualizes
and objectifies women
erving goffman conducted
research on advertisements
and how they
are consistently reinforcing
common stereotypes of
women he outlined
different characteristics commonly
found in media
that tend to
favor men over
women these stereotypes
which can all
be found in
gucci's advertisements include
relative size ritualization
of subordination feminine
touch and function
ranking almost all
of gucci's advertisements include
a woman who
is being dismembered
to show off
a certain part
of her body
positioned in a
way that some
would consider sexualizes
her body or
made much smaller
in size to
appear submissive to
the counterpart in
the ad jean
kilbourne describes how
often advertisements are
working to undermine
women and place
women in positions
of passivity many
people find these
advertisements offensive and
in turn many
organizations have publicly
criticized gucci the
fashion law a
fashion legal and
business website argues
that the infamous
line sex sells
is proven through
gucci's continual use
of scandalous advertisements
and correlating sales
gucci became popular
in the early
1920s by fashion
designer guccio gucci
but the controversial
advertisement did not
begin until tom
ford and subsequently
frida giannini took
over the business
1920s print ads
were not nearly
as popular in
the fashion industry
as they are
today after frida
giannini became the
creative director for
the business sales
reached an all-time high in
part due to
the advertisements drawing
mass amounts of
attention to the
brand name in
early 2003 gucci
produced a highly
popular advertisement which
pictured a super
model with her
pants pulled down
and her pubic
hair shaved into
a g the
advertising standards authority
received countless complaints
from people and
organizations including the
director of mediawatchuk
demanding the ad
be banned due
to his belief
it was harmful
to society many
believed that the
outcry regarding the
ad just fed
the idea that
gucci was using
sex to successfully
sell their products
although this was
a point of
contention between gucci
and the advertising
standards authority scholars
have shown that
gucci continues to
walk the thin
line between offensive
and acceptable advertisements
despite the fact
that gucci's pubic enemy
ad was banned
worldwide instantly the
italian luxury brand
still continues to
publish controversial ads
in order to
promote their spring/summer 2016 collection
gucci used a
short film and
images with reference
to a cult
film about drug
addiction the campaign
advertisement depicted women
dealing with drugs
and prostitution the
film the gucci
ad is inspired
by is based
on a 14-year-old heroin addict
and sex workers's true story
a scene in
the gucci campaign
takes place in
a subway/railway station usually
connected with prostitution
and drug trade in the film
the main character
and her boyfriend
sell their bodies
at that same
place called the
bahnhof zoo this
advertisement received a
lot of backlash
primarily because one
of their young
models was unhealthily
thin according to
the advertising standards
authority this advertisement
may sound shocking
to some but
to the advertisement
industry it is
a prime example
of what they
are supposed to
do william o'barr argues that
advertisements main priority
is to break
through and draw
the consumer's attention regardless
deemed appropriate in
society's eyes gucci
has had a
partnership with unicef
since 2005 gucci

a percentage of

years old were
sold by randy
knight to an
anonymous collector for
$60 000 00
through internet auction
site ebay on
15 june 2005
there are said
to be only
two or three
complete pairs of
authentic pre-1900 levi's 501 jeans
in existence and
these are the
first pair found
that is still
wearable this particular
pair of jeans
was found by
four friends in
an abandoned-silver mine in

1998 they feature
the distinctive levi's arcuate stitching
on the back
of one pocket
the two horse
leather patch a
watch pocket a
button fly and
copper rivets when
found the jeans
had never been
washed and it
is thought that
the slurry and
mud from the
mine helped with
their preservation they
have since been
washed and wrapped
in unbleached muslin
material to store
them miuccia inherited
the company in
1978 by which
time sales were
up to u
s $450 000 with
bertelli alongside her
as business manager
miuccia was allowed
time to implement
her creativity in
the company's designs she
would go on
to incorporate her
ideas into the
house of prada
that would change
it she released
her first set
of backpacks and
totes in 1979
they were made
out of a
tough military spec
black nylon that
her grandfather had
used as coverings
for steamer trunks
initial success was
not instant as
they were hard
to sell due
to the lack
of advertising and
high-prices but the
lines would go
on to become
her first commercial
hit next miuccia
and bertelli sought
out wholesale accounts
for the bags
in upscale department
stores and boutiques
worldwide in 1983
prada opened a
second boutique in
the centre of
the galleria vittorio
emanuele in milan's shopping heart
on the site
of the previous
historic london house
emporium run by
felice bellini from
1870 to the
1960s reminiscent to
the original shop
but with a
sleek and modern
contrast to it
the next big
release was a
nylon tote that
same year the

continental europe by
opening locations in
prominent shopping districts
within florence paris
madrid and new
york city a
shoe line was
also released in
1984 in 1985
miuccia released the
classic prada handbag
that became an
overnight sensation although
practical and sturdy
its sleek lines
and craftsmanship exuded
an offhand aura
of luxury that
has become the
prada signature in
1987 miuccia and
bertelli married prada
launched its women's ready-to-wear collection in
1989 and the
designs came to
be known for
their dropped waistlines
and narrow belts
prada's popularity skyrocketed
when the fashion
world took notice
of its clean
lines opulent fabrics
and basic colors
the logo for
the label was
not as obvious
a design element
as those on
bags from other
prominent luxury brands
such as louis
vuitton it tried
to market its
lack of prestigious
appeal including the
apparel was its
image of anti-status or reverse

in 1927 miuccia
prada was not
present at the
showing of her
spring/summer 16 womenswear
collection in milan
– and yet her
presence could be
felt everywhere it
was a prada
collection and show
par excellence – both strangely familiar
yet strangely strange
in oma's floating set
suspended sheets of
curved and corrugated
fibre glass and
plastic were a
ghostly mimic for
a rougher metal
real world version
of events so
too were the
clothes where the
bourgeois tweed suit
became almost a
delicate apparition reworked
in transparencies sometimes
intercut with aprons
of original traditional
tweed then time
would almost be
literally sliced in
clothing made from
strips of fabric
in patent leather
fur or the
finest couture fabrics
were these 20s
art deco stripes? 60s youthquake 
signifiers signs of the
sportswear of now? or was this
simply something of
the future built
on the many
iterations of the
past? what was taking
place in fact
seemed to be
a rushing together
of the past
present and future
an almost autobiographical
overview from the
person of miuccia
prada – who was herself
both there and
not there her
long-term collaborator frederic
sanchez's auditory accompaniment
was composed of
ghostly snatches and
layers of jazz
which he defined
as a disorientation
of time where
your head is
full of memories
– fragments of a
life the stylist
of the show
olivier rizzo described
miuccia's life as
an eccentric clash
of culture and
knowledge where there
are so many
years of her
looking at the
world and of
her being in
the world the
show's hairstylist guido
palau created hair
that purposely traversed
the lines of
kiss-curled flapper skin
girl rebel and
‘baby-fringed' scally girl there
is an idea
of tricking the
eye – it could be
seen as nostalgic
but it isn't he explained
there is always
something else at
work something strange
miuccia is always
looking for the
‘tipping point' – something 
slightly uncomfortable
and unconventional she
has no fear
in challenging people's perceptions of
beauty for fabio
zambernardi miuccia prada's design director
there were so
many layers of
information but miuccia
ultimately thought it
should be beautiful
and chic we
simply wanted to
do something chic
for a prada
woman with experience
and knowledge who
likes beautiful clothes
that's why miuccia
became obsessed with
suits of course
she gets bored
of suits in
a second! but that is
why they also
became an obsession
for her prada
perfection: even when it's wrong it
must be absolutely
right 'who is this
woman who wears
a suit? is it too
old? is it wrong?' very often she
likes to hate
things she hates
things so much
it suddenly becomes
what she likes! so says fabio
zambernardi of miuccia
prada's spin on
the socratic method
that is her
design process in
the world of
prada perfection is
paramount but this
is a perfection
that is not
easily won: even wrongness has
to be absolutely
right the sensibility
knowledge and knowhow
at prada – a creative sensitive
and emotional combination
– is like nowhere
else says olivier
rizzo to work
for somebody so
incredible so legendary
and larger than
life as mrs
prada together with
the wonderful fabio
zambernardi – it's like heaven
with the fashion
show you are
constantly challenged in
a good way every fibre of
your being is
challenged creatively emotionally
and mentally you
question yourself so
much and miuccia
prada encourages rebellion
as a state
of mind – she is constantly
questioning and challenging
herself she sets
the example it
is her detail
thinking process and
freedom that opens
up everything that
looks at and
creates all the
possibilities everything has
to gel for
a show everything
– and the openness
of mind and
courage it takes
for her thought
and word process
blows my mind
of course miuccia
prada knew every
finite detail and
process of her
latest show and
collection – she was there
until its ultimate
completion but perhaps
where her spirit
was most present
was in the
rebellious chic wrongness
of it all
– the sort of
wrongness that only
miuccia prada as
a designer can
make seem absolutely
right and right
now the figure
of tutankhamen and
the 20s egyptian
revival could be
found in those
coats made of
strips of gilded
python and delicate
suede as well
as in make-up artist pat
mcgrath's gold lips the ghostly versions
of 90s prada
past made transparent
in brown and
orange stripes the fabric veils
draped across the
models chests original
fabrics from the
20s unique and
rare with a
finite supply fully
utilised for the
show the purposely plodding
knits and prints
layered underneath and
throwing everything off… when I was
eight years old
my grandmother decided
to make me
a sweater and
asked me to
choose the colours
says fabio zambernardi
i was very
excited so excited
i actually could
not choose… in the end
i chose brown
and yellow! as a kid
miuccia was also
attracted to things
that were so
horrible and ugly
colours so wrong
they become right
in the latest
collection such wrongness
of colouration was
everywhere present but
particularly in the
home-style domesticity of
the knitted sweaters
layered under elegant
flapper dresses or
the ornately embroidered
suiting of the
finale a touch
of childlike domestic
glee that could
also be found
in the key
print of the
show again layered
under elegant suiting
or dresses yet
looking like a
child's bedspread or
wallpaper here the
details are a
race car a
rabbit and a
rocket – miuccia prada's eldest son
is a race
car driver the
rabbit is for
luck and the
rocket for the
future such autobiographical
signs and symbols
of miuccia prada
can be found
everywhere in the
collection as they
can be in
all of pradaland
– including one of
its newest attractions:

in saks holdings
inc of the
united states has
reported that earnings
rose 29 percent

overhaul and sale
of gucci the
italian producer of
luxury goods the
company said on
sunday that earnings
increased to $90 4 million
from $70 3 million
in 1995 the
profit growth came
largely because of
the sale of
investcorp's remaining 51
percent stake in
gucci last march
for about $1 45 billion
investcorp had sold
49 percent in
a $539 million offering
during 1995 among

creative director frida
giannini has left
the fashion house
a month earlier
than planned as
a new chief
executive officer begins
reviving the brand
giannini exited the
company last week
the brand's owner kering
sa said today
the men's and women's collections will
be presented as
planned on jan
19 and feb
25 respectively gucci
said in a
statement an announcement
on giannini's successor will
be made in due course
the maker of
$650 horsebit loafers
said marco bizzarri
started as ceo
this month as
kering shakes up
its biggest brand
after five quarters
of little to
no growth kering
announced last month
that giannini and
former ceo patrizio
di marco her
partner were leaving
i would like
to take this
opportunity to acknowledge
the outstanding contribution
that frida giannini
has made to
gucci's legacy during
her nine-year tenure as
creative director bizzarri said in
the statement forget
the sheared mink
the diamond-encrusted wristwatch or
the newest louis
vuitton bag the latest luxury
item comes in
straight leg or
boot cut stonewashed
or torn jeans
have come a
long way from
their working-class origins no
longer reserved for
physical labor or
college campuses today's
haute dungarees
are increasingly acceptable
at dinner parties
the office all
but the most
formal occasions still
even though jeans
in the closets
of both billionaires
and bikers there
can be a
big difference in
their price tags
a difference? while a pair
of levi's can be
bought for less
than $20 at wal-mart
stores guinness
world records cites
the gucci genius
jeans as the
most expensive jeans
a normal pair
of gucci jeans
that had been
distressed ripped and
covered with african
beads when they
debuted in october
1998 in milan
were priced at
an astonishing $3 134 if
you think that
sounds like a
lot of money
today there are
jeans for more
than double that
amount click here
for the slide
while many
women and some men are willing to
pay as much
as $145 without giving
it a second
thought increasingly designer
labels are offering
jeans ranging from
$300 to as
much as $4 000 for
those who want
exclusivity there are
custom couture jeans
with prices that
are even higher
for the most
part our jeans
are in the
$150 to $225 range but
there are in
designer some very
expensive jeans and
it's because they're highly embellished
and have treatments
that really bring
the price point
up says colleen
sherin fashion market
director at retailer
saks fifth avenue
regardless of whether
they are embellished
or embroidered covered
with beads or
precious gems to
many people even
those who could
easily afford it
the notion of
paying thousands of
dollars for jeans they are still
jeans after all is ridiculous for
others though having
a signature label
in the back
is as much
a status symbol
as the hood
ornament on a
mercedes these are
people who want
the look of
the moment hot
off the runway
and regardless of
the price says
sherin so why
why now? marshal cohen at
npd group a
port washington n
based retail-industry consulting firm
says that not
only have prices
gone up but
sales have too
this is a
trend that has
been hot for
almost five years
now which in
is very rare
denim has become
not only a
staple in the
wardrobe but it's become a
premium product it's at an
all-time high in
price and in
prestige until something
really comes along
that can take
its place it's here to
stay according to
npd jeans that
cost more than
$100 make up
only 1% of the $14 billion industry
but it's a quickly
rising business in
2004 women's jeans sales
were $7 4 billion
up 12% from $6 6 billion
in 2003 at
department stores such
as saks the
best-selling jeans are
brands like seven
for all mankind
citizens of humanity
true religion and
hudson jeans to
name a few
it's in these
lines that many
companies such as
apparel group innovo
and liz claiborne
are making their
investments these premium
jeans didn't make our
list of most
expensive but at
prices ranging from
$150 to $225 they do
anyone would have
paid for jordache
or calvin klein
in the 1980s
the most expensive
jeans fall into
the category of
custom made or
vintage levi strauss
& co spent $46 532 buying
a pair of
its own jeans
on an ebay
auction in may
2001 the jeans
were found in
a nevada mining
town and date
back to the
1880s the company
has no plans
to resell them
because levi's says they
are priceless and
one of a
kind for that
reason these and
other vintage jeans
were left off
our list it
the age the
label or a
flattering fit that
drives up the
price of today's most expensive
jeans much of
the added cost
comes from the
decorations and fixtures
such as 14
karat gold or
silver rivets and
diamond buttons the
jeans that top
our list come
from escada's couture line
they start at
$7 500 and
have no price
cap so far
pair they have
made cost $10 000 and
were studded from
top to bottom
with swarovski crystals
is this willingness
to spend thousands
on denim a
sign of decadence
or a relaxing
of the barriers
between high fashion
and comfortable clothes?
marshal cohen of
npd says we've reached the
point in that
number one denim
is being viewed
as an investment
like jewelry and
hand bags and
that number two
like women with
a shoe fetish
there are now
women with a
denim fetish everyone
woman and man
is in the
quest for the
perfect jean and
will be for
a long time
an original pair
of levi strauss
& co 501 jeans
the distinctive
levi's arcuate stitching
button fly and
them the news
- and the talent
- is in: alessandro michele formerly
associate to gucci's
ex-creative director frida
giannini has himself
now been appointed
creative director of
gucci the news
was strategically announced
yesterday to steal
a march on
the opening day
of the autumn/winter 2015 paris
menswear collections it
came as no
enormous surprise despite
rumours swirling that
names in the
running included tomas
maier or givenchy's riccardo tisci
those names could
easily be seduced
by a brand
with the heft
of gucci: it's value is
estimated as £8 2bn by
forbes as far
as luxury brands
go it is
only bettered in
those figures by
louis vuitton but
thrusting a behind-the-scenes
do-gooder like michele
into the limelight
doesn't just make
for newsworthy cinderella-style
straplines it's something of
a trend right
now: largely unknown designers
have been appointed
to high-profile roles at
hermes and sonia
rykiel a former
céline accessories designer
johnny coca has
been named artistic
director of mulberry
there's also a
history of back
room hires at
gucci itself the
most famous one? tom ford who
slogged it out
for four years
at gucci before
getting his place
in the sun
as creative director
in 1994 frida
giannini herself originally
designed gucci's handbags before
taking on womenswear
and finally full
label's output in
2006 she departed
earlier this year
almost two months
ahead of previously-announced
plans - in an unusual
step she was
to present a
final men's and women's collection for
the house despite
her departure having
been confirmed maybe
she found that
whole situation too
uncomfortable to see
through? or maybe gucci
were keen to
usher in the
new? out of the
gaggle of back
room hands that
straggled at the
top of gucci's catwalk on
monday taking bows
for an autumn/winter 2015 collection
completely reworked in
the days - not weeks - after
giannini' left michele stood
out with curly
hair to his
shoulders you wondered
if the bohemian
air of the
collection was somehow
a reflection of
his personal style? it emerged that
it had been
created under his
leadership that winter
menswear offering was
certainly different to
the direction taken
by giannini pointedly
so: floaty rather than
slick trousers wide rather
than narrow blowsy and romantic
and florentine rather
than sharp and
sixties and roman
it's unclear if
that hastily pulled-together
collection and
the largely-positive press reaction
to it sealed
the deal for
michele with kering
chairman and ceo
françois-henri pinault and
the new gucci
president and ceo
marco bizzarri both
released complimentary - and
complementary - statements pinault commenting
that michele will
lead into an
exciting new creative
chapter and bizzarri
enforcing michele's appointment as
clear indication that
the brand is
ready to take
a new direction
new is the important
word there that's what gucci
are after: something new from
someone new michele
passed the first
test - which seemed to
be a time-trial the gucci
womenswear show presented
in february will
be the real
litmus yves saint
laurent is not
the only brand
on luxury conglomerate
kering's mind today
changes are underway
for ysl's sister brand
gucci the cash
cow of the
kering roster as
susan chokachi has
been promoted to
the role of
president and chief
executive officer of
gucci america effective
immediately chokachi who
joined gucci group
in 1998 most
recently held the
role of senior
vice president of
marketing and communications
she is succeeding
christoper de pous
who left the
company last month
after spending three
years in the
role of gucci
america ceo according
to a statement
from marco bizzarri
gucci president and
ceo: we are fortunate
to be able
to call upon
someone of susan's talent and
experience to take
on the leadership
role at gucci
america at this
important time with
the brand's new direction
now firmly established
we are seeing
exciting momentum building
behind the brand
in north america
and I am
confident that susan
and her team
will be able
to capitalize on
this in a
market that continues
to offer significant
growth potential for
gucci a replacement for

company louis vuitton
collaborated with the
nazis during the
german occupation of
france in the
second world war
according to a
new book a
french author has
uncovered previously unpublished
details of the
firm's support for
the vichy regime
which was responsible
for the deportation
of french jews
to german concentration
camps the book
french saga says
members of the
vuitton family actively
supported the puppet
government led by
marshal philippe pétain
and made money
dealings with the
germans its author
stephanie bonvicini says
she made the
discovery while researching
the rags-to-riches story of
the firm's founder louis
vuitton to mark
this year louis
vuitton's lv-embossed suitcases and
bags are popular
with a wealthy
and famous clientele
including the beckhams
the models kate
moss and naomi
campbell and the
actors sharon stone
and elizabeth hurley
the company is
now owned by
the lvmh group
which recently opened
two huge stores
in paris and
new york bonvicini
says she was
given full cooperation
by the firm
when she proposed
writing the book
a year ago
but when she
asked about its
wartime activities she
was told that
company documents for
the years 1930
to 1945 had
been destroyed in
a fire their
attitude changed completely
the moment I
mentioned the war
years from being
very helpful to
not responding to
questions at all
she said from
historical archives she
discovered that louis
vuitton had a
store on the
ground floor of
a fabulous property
the hotel du
parc in vichy
where pétain set
up his puppet
government while the
other shopkeepers including
the jewellers van
cleef & arpels were shut
down vuitton was
the only one
allowed to stay
bonvicini says she
talked to surviving
family members and
found that vuitton's grandson gaston
the wartime head
had instructed his
eldest son henry
to forge links
with the pétain
regime to keep
the business going
henry a regular
at the local
cafe frequented by
the gestapo was
first frenchmen to
be decorated by
the nazi-backed government for
his loyalty and
his efforts for
the regime but
the most damaging
allegation is that
the family set
up a factory
dedicated to producing
artefacts glorifying pétain
including more than
2 500 busts
a fact not
mentioned in any
of its business
records part of
the collaboration was
family's obsession with
the survival of
the company and
part down to
the fact that
there was a
certain sympathy with
the regime's rightwing views
the author said
louis vuitton born
in rural france
in 1821 set
up his company
in 1854 after
travelling to paris
at the age
of 14 with
just a few
francs in his
pocket later he
made trunks for
the french empress
eugénie after louis
died in 1892
his son georges
expanded the company
and developed the
world's first designer

the distinctive beige-on-brown lv monogram

bonvicini says the
company was at
first extremely keen
on the book
and promised to
promote it and
ensure it was
published in english
and japanese but
since it appeared
on april 7
lvmh has wanted
nothing to do
with it and
it has received
little press coverage
the head of
lvmh bernard arnault
is one of
the richest men
in france and
the firm is
the country's biggest advertiser
caroline babulle a
spokeswoman for the
publisher fayard said: they have not
the book but
doesn't exist bonvicini
added: nobody is prepared
to risk losing
their advertising revenue
but it's scandalous that
everyone is just
ignoring the book
i can't understand why
the company has
adopted this attitude
the vuittons weren't the only
ones to collaborate
and of course
the company's values have
changed now a

the wartime period

constituency in america

council in france
the first he
had heard of
the book or
the allegations "it is extremely
important that these
matters are publicised

the general public
"however since the
people involved are
now dead it
would seem ridiculous
to organise a
boycott of louis

would not want
that if they
were still involved
in anti-semitic activities that
would be different
what does shock
but not surprise
me is that
the french press
has not publicised
this book and
that i'm hearing about
it from a
foreign journalist but
that's the french
press nicolas ghesquière

bring a gust
of experimental fashion

director of women's collections confirming
a widely expected

the designer — who catapulted balenciaga
to the forefront
of the paris
fashion agenda — would show his
first collection here

on monday afternoon
came almost a
year to the

more upscale and
elite reputation after
years of rapid
global expansion and
a heavy reliance

dynamic attitude of
the company an
artist named nadia
plesner recently put
together a project
to try to
raise money for
the victims of
genocide in darfur
as part of
the campaign she
created a t-shirt with a
drawn image of
a darfur victim
pimped out to
look like paris
hilton  that is carrying
a designer handbag
and a small
dressed up dog
the entire profits
from the t-shirts are going
to help the
victims the handbag
drawn in the
image is not
specifically a louis
vuitton bag but
the design firm
seems to have
gone ballistic claiming
all sorts of
intellectual property rights
it simply does
not possess first
it sent a
cease-and-desist which plesner
wrote about on
the site while
responding and telling
the company that
she would not
take down the
t-shirt or the
image in response
lv went from
friendly to nasty
it sued demanding
$7 500 for
each day she
keeps selling the
product $7 500 for
displays its original
cease-and-desist letter and
mentions the name
louis vuitton on
her website while
there may be
some difference due
to the specifics
of trademark law
in europe it's hard to
see how this
is not overreaching
this is an
entirely non-commercial venture all
of the profits
are given to
charity the design
has some differences
from the louis
vuitton bag and
hardly seems likely
to specifically damage
brand the t-shirts are clearly
not competing with
louis vuitton and
there's little reason
to have anyone
think that louis
vuitton somehow endorsed
this effort furthermore
posting the cease-and-desist or even
mentioning the name
louis vuitton simply
should not be
infringing activities I
don't know if
europe has the
equivalent of the
moron in a

for the week
earlier this week
we ran a
q&a with nadia
plesner the danish
art student embroiled
in a copyright
lawsuit with louis
vuitton she created
an image depicting
a darfurian child
holding a bag
based on a
louis vuitton design
for a campaign
to raise awareness
of the ongoing
her message is
that we care
more about items
like the vuitton
purse and the
celebrities that carry
them than serious
issues like darfur
today a spokeswoman
from louis vuitton
rang us up
to offer their
side of the
story she said
initially did not
ask for damages
when it noticed
the colors and
design of the
bag in plesner's painting appeared
to be an
exact copy of
the audra bag
pictured above they
sent plesner a
letter asking her
to respect the
rights of other
artists like louis
vuitton creative director
marc jacobs and
artist takashi murakami
who designed the
bag plesner didn't respond to
the letter but
continued her campaign
and posted the
letter on her
website the spokeswoman
also noted when
plesner started the
campaign she was
donating 30 percent
from the sale
of t-shirts and posters
with the image
since plesner didn't respond to
house went to
court in paris
to file an
injunction on march
25 the court
declared the image
was a clear
infringement of louis
vuitton's copyright on
the bag and
ordered plesner to
cease and desist
when plesner ignored
this injunction louis
vuitton took further
action and asked
for 5 000
euros for each
day she continued
to sell the
product if companies
don't take action
to protect trademarks
it's harder to
do so in
the future the
spokeswoman said I
just think the
way she's portraying this
she's not telling
what louis vuitton
did to prevent
the lawsuit she
added louis vuitton
is not trying
to stop plesner's campaign and
hopes to find
a solution to
allow it to
continue without infringing
on louis vuitton's intellectual
property rights danish
26-year-old art student
nadia plesner designed
this t-shirt depicting a
darfurian child holding
bag with a
chihuahua on his
shoulder the message
media covers meaningless
things like handbags
and paris hilton's pooch instead
of the issues
that matter so
plesner dressed a
darfurian child like
paris so that
maybe just maybe
the world would
pay attention louis
vuitton sure did! in february they
slammed plesner with
a copyright lawsuit
demanding $20 000 a
day for each
to use this
image and reimbursement
for legal fees
plesner refused to
stop using the
image and on
may 30 she's scheduled to
meet with louis
vuitton in paris
with her lawyer
we rang her
up today in
amsterdam where she
goes to art
school to get
her side of
the story why
did you choose
this louis vuitton
bag?
i was trying
to think of
what assets to
give the small
boy so that
people would relate
to the images
we see on
most front pages
i changed the
design a little
bit so it
wouldn't be a
complete copy but
it's meant to
be a designer
bag in general
but this is
clearly a louis
vuitton bag I
think some of
the symbols in
the world become
so well known
they are more
than what they
are like the
mcdonald's logo or
the coca-cola logo — they relate to
other things than
the item itself
and I was
looking for something
that has these
colors and was
oversized compared to
the boy you
don't think say
a fendi bag
has the same
cache?
i've traveled all
over the world
in places like
asia and thailand
and these kinds
of bags in
these colors are
what i've seen the
most everywhere not
only the real
bags but the
copies — everybody wants to
buy them to
display a specific
image and that's what I
was trying to
show did you
think about changing
the design once
the suit hit?
yeah I discussed
these options with
my lawyer but
i feel like
i made the
drawing in a
way the image
is most powerful
i thought as
an artist I
was free to
make the art
like I wanted
because it's producing a
caricature if I
was making bags
copying the design
i would understand
the problem but
i have the
artistic freedom to
display the caricatures
that I want
to so to
you the louis
vuitton brand resonates
more than any
other?
resonates in a
way that people
understand it when
they see it
if I had
used another bag
it wouldn't have been
as strong you
see these bags
on all the
magazine covers right
now if paris
hilton and lindsay
lohan were all
wearing plastic bags
i would have
made a plastic
bag on my
drawing how did
you feel when
you learned of
the lawsuit?
well the first
five minutes I
was a little
bit shocked and
a little bit
intimidated because it's quite a
big amount they're asking from
me because i'm a student
fear didn't motivate you
to stop using
the image right
away?
i felt stubborn
because I worked
really hard for
this campaign it
was just starting
when they contacted
me I want
to continue and
i felt my
only option was
to find a
lawyer and contact
media who want
to share my
story you've gotten enormous
response in media
and on your
website how much
does that surprise
you?
i'm very surprised
but i'm also very
happy I think
this lawsuit has
given my campaign
more attention than
i ever would
have gotten without
it are you
nervous about the
meeting in paris?
i'm very interested
in what they
have to say
about it yes
i'm nervous but
i'm also very
curious about how
they're going to
respond to all
this so far
i've only received
the first letter
and then the
lawsuit that is
kind of harsh
in the way
it's presented i'm not interested
in a big
trial and hope
we can find
some kind of
settlement obviously I
would like to
continue my campaign
how will you
pay a fine
if that's what it
comes to?
right now i'm trying to
legal fund on
my website i've had some
e-mails from people
who — in case I
have to pay
a big fine
— would like to
help you're studying filmmaking
have you considered
turning this story
into a film?
my teacher at
the art academy
suggested I should
tape parts of
it to document
it for myself
i have been
contacted by a
swedish guy who
makes documentaries — he asked if
i'd be interested
in a documentary
i'm not sure
to do it
because if I
agree I want
it to be
about darfur if
it's going to
be about me
and my trial
it doesn't help my
campaign so much
it was never
my intention to
stand in the
spotlight myself I
just wanted to
start a debate
and i'm trying to
give my interviews
in a way
to show this
paris — luxury goods maker
louis vuitton has
that alleged a
britney spears music
video violated counterfeiting
laws by showcasing
a pink vuitton-upholstered dashboard a
paris civil court
ordered sony bmg
and mtv online
to stop broadcasting
or marketing the
video for do
something in any
form and fined
them 80 000
euros apiece a
spokeswoman for paris-based louis vuitton
said monday the
ruling was handed
down last week
in the opening
scenes of the
video spears appears
in the driver's seat of
a hot pink
hummer floating on
make-believe clouds one
shot shows fingers
drumming on a
dashboard covered with
what looks like
vuitton's cherry blossoms
design: dark pink blossoms
on a pale
pink weblike background
embossed with the
lv logo the
court did not
find spears herself
guilty but ruled
that sony bmg
were guilty of
violating counterfeiting laws
the ruling said
the video constituted
an attack on
louis vuitton's brands and
its luxury image
the spokeswoman said
it was not
immediately clear how
the ban would
be enforced or
whether the companies
would appeal mtv
declined to comment
on the ruling
sony bmg did
not immediately respond
to requests for
comment the video
was still on
youtube and other
music web sites
visible in france
on monday on
a few sites
however links to
the video led
to a blank
screen or one

whose signature handbags
are a prime
target of counterfeiters
worldwide has fought
vigorously through french
and other courts
to protect its

division of lvmh
vuitton sa even
if you don't read russian
a recent print
ad for louis
vuitton is something
of a visual
joke: mikhail s gorbachev
the last leader
of the old
soviet union sits
in a limousine
as it passes
a remaining part
of the berlin
wall an open
louis vuitton bag
beside him if
you do read
russian the ad
seems to be
even more curious: poking out of
the bag is
a publication with
the headline the murder of
litvinenko: they wanted to
give up the
suspect for $7 000 the reference is
to alexander v
litvinenko the former
k g b
spy who died
last november after
being poisoned with
a radioactive isotope
polonium 210 on
his deathbed mr
litvinenko accused president
vladimir v putin
of orchestrating his
murder the british authorities
have accused one
of mr litvinenko's associates andrei
k lugovoi of
the crime and
have requested his
extradition from russia
which the kremlin
has refused last
week as the
translation of the
headline in the
ad started circulating
on the internet
some natural questions
arose was the
message placed there
deliberately? and what did
it mean? both louis vuitton
and its ad
agency ogilvy & mather were quick
to dismiss any
significance our company has
absolutely no intention
to pass any
other messages than
the one on
‘personal journeys the gist of
which mr gorbachev
appeared said pietro
beccari director of
marketing at louis
vuitton in an
e-mail message besides
he said if
the placement had
been deliberate the
words would not
have been put
upside down in
cyrillic and in
need of a
magnifying lens to
be read the
ad was photographed
on june 1
by annie leibovitz
daniel sicouri ogilvy's chief executive
for europe the
middle east and
africa also denied
any political undertones
saying ms leibovitz's stylists brought
russian magazines to
the photo shoot
to make the
pictures look authentic
and any reference
to the litvinenko
affair was coincidental
remember at that
time this was
the news of
the day he
said whatever the news
of the day
is includes political
information a representative
of mr gorbachev
said he had
been unaware of
the contents of
the magazine during
he was perplexed by
this thing when
it was brought
to his attention
a few days
ago pavel palazhchenko mr
gorbachev's personal aide
and translator wrote
by e-mail as a separate
matter he said
gorbachev's position on
the litvinenko affair
is that it
should be thoroughly
investigated as a
criminal case but
not everyone is
convinced that this
all was serendipitous
in an industry
where sesame seeds
are hand-placed on a
hamburger bun by
food technicians before
a shot one
would reasonably assume
that this was
not something that
happened by chance
said robert passikoff
president of a
brand research consultancy
brand keys ads like these
get art-directed to the
very millimeter and
airbrushed so that
the advertiser gets
exactly what they
want perhaps the
advertiser is getting
just that mr
passikoff said given that louis
vuitton and ogilvy
are receiving precisely
attention and buzz
that is regarded
as being the
measure of success
these days it
counteracts those effects
if they admit
to doing it
he said once you declare
it was an
overt and planned
act it has

and producer pharrell
williams epitomises this
commercial turn as
50 per cent
of the neptunes
production team  a partnership with
his high-school homeboy
filipino-american chad hugo
 he's perhaps the
music industry's most in-demand hit maker
yet he also
embodies the genre's outsider ethos:
the possibility of
socially marginalised kids
rising to the
top he spent
the first seven
years of life
in the housing
projects of virginia
beach now platinum-plated artists such
as justin timberlake
christina aguilera jay-z nelly usher
and kanye west
line up for
the production duo's golden touch

neptunes productions accounted
for 43 per
cent of tracks
aired on american
radio their handiwork
fuses rap with
rock folk and
rhythm and blues
creating eclectic sounds
that williams 35
is at a
loss to describe
um I don't know it's just music
he says i'm not sure
if we have
a title for
it to author

he's one-third of the

with hugo and
fellow vah beach
native vocalist sheldon
shay haley the
hip-hop outfit which
made its debut
with 2001's in search
of will tour
australia next month
of its third
album last year's seeing sounds
the title refers
to the visual
process of crafting
beats williams says: producing is a
creative platform where
we zone out
and conjure images
and organise them
as music after
the band's second album
2004's fly or
die williams announced
that had disbanded
when in search
of had netted
the shortlist music
prize in 2002
williams used his
acceptance speech to
flay virgin records
for inadequately spruiking
the album and
he now says
the ensemble never
really separated but
just trying to
get off of
our label he
explains: we just had
to wait it
out but it's not a
feud he wants
to revisit crooning: naaah
it's irrelevant spilled milk is
cool he drives
a black ferrari
enzo and owns
two rolls-royces but in
other ways the
frontman is an
unusually retiring megastar
comfortable staying behind
the curtain producing
tracks for others
williams was 32
before he brought
out a solo
album in my
mind it received
tepid reviews the
consensus being that
his off-kilter curtis
mayfield-like falsetto was
insufficient on its
own the lead
single can I
have it like
that featuring gwen
stefani came out
almost a year
earlier but the
album was delayed
because of williams's producing commitments
if his solo
career didn't seem a
priority that's because it
wasn't williams admits
he has no
interest in going
it alone again
and regrets that
in my mind
wasn't a collaborative
effort so many
people could have
done such a
better job than
me he says
i wasn't cut out
it required to
be a solo
artist I like
having my friends
around williams and
hugo became pals
aged 12 when
they bonded at
a summer band
camp and got
together to play
jazz: williams on drums
and keyboard hugo
on tenor saxophone
williams's mother carolyn
a teacher and
father pharoah a
handyman moved out
of the inner-city projects to
the suburbs when
williams was seven
he can't imagine where
he'd be now
if they hadn't relocated you
become a product
of the environment
he says you
may end up
being a good
person and law-abiding but you
struggle to do
it because it's very hard
to live on
modest means there's not a
lot of places
you can turn
you get turned
away at high
school williams and
hugo met shay
and formed a
trio I had
a drum machine
of my volkswagen
bus hugo recalls
and popped it
open connected it
to my kicker
speaker system and
started beatboxing shay
started dancing and
mayhem broke loose
then a friend
of ours took
a spraycan and
sprayed nerd across
the van the
band met regularly
in hugo's family garage
we were just
dumb dimwits trying
to be accepted
hugo says adding
that aims to
create a punk
sensibility their fans
hugo continues are
nerdy quirky chunky
pretty pretty ugly
fugly hot-arse people it's a view
williams echoes: we're trying to
build a platform
of this world
where everyone is
accepted with his
choirboy looks and
slightness of speech
and frame williams
bucks the archetype
of the thuggish
hip-hop artist he's been called
a proponent of
a new geek
chic a fan
of science fiction
he punctuates performances
with vulcan salutes
and describes himself
as a discovery
channel guy who
browses in bookshops
to unwind: i've read a
lot of neuro-linguistic
programming books
and i'm a scientific
american fan he
says all of
our fans are
in love with
the discovery channel
and history and
history international of
course they are! for all his
claims that pierre-alexis dumas the
hermès artistic director
spent the afternoon
at the museum
of modern art
taking in its
exhibition of studio
photography it had
given him he
said tuesday evening
a yen for
ray k metzker
which is part
mr dumas is
an appreciator of
photography though his
work at hermès
includes overseeing its
many designers and
craftspeople he also
manages its sizable
collection of art
and photography in
addition he is
the president of
the fondation d'entreprise hermès which
supports artists through
residencies mentorship funding
and exposure you can create
the conditions for
something beautiful to
happen he said
this is how
i see my
work in general
as an artistic
director mr dumas
was not in
new york for
a quick moma
visit he had
come for the
aperture foundation annual
benefit to announce
a new alliance
between the hermès
foundation and aperture
it will include
a commission program
for which a
french photographer will
be sponsored to
produce a project
in the united
states followed by
an american photographer
sponsored to produce
one in france
aperture will also
publish books on
its projects and
its gallery will
become the american
site for the
henri cartier-bresson international award
which hermès supports
it's the kind
of thing that
has been beyond
our means said
chris boot the
executive director of
the aperture foundation
mr dumas emphasized
that the foundation's attention is
on such projects
not itself this foundation doesn't have a
venue a big
expensive building made
by a famous
architect he said
presumably a veiled
reference to the
fondation louis vuitton
which will open
its frank gehry-designed home in
paris next week
really we wanted
from the beginning
to put all
the means we
have in projects
helping people to
produce their work
nevertheless photography in
particular has a
personal resonance his
father jean-louis dumas was
a hobbyist who
carried a camera
everywhere and created
a darkroom in
the family bathroom
i would be
a very bad
photographer mr dumas
said but i'm good at
looking at photography
has a message
he shied away
from the pro-democratic party activities
of fellow rappers
such as ludacris
and usher during
the us presidential
election campaign wasn't he tempted
to throw his
weight behind barack
obama? I supported him
in whatever ways
that I could
he says sounding
faintly apologetic I
voted I mean
it wasn't about the
campaign it was
just about the
movement in the
air and whatever
you could do
as an individual
to bring life
to a situation
pressed for clarification
williams drawls: uuuum I did
a couple of
things such as? aaaghhh it's not important
since the financial
meltdown hip hoppers
such as diddy
have toned down
their jewellery out
of respect for
ordinary workers being
shown the door
but williams remains
obsessed with bling
with his array
of custom gold-plated objects including
several blackberries an
ipod a nintendo
ds and an
iphone he apes
his boyhood television
hero richie rich
he used to
have everything made
out of gold
williams recalls but
he professes to
be drawn to
gilded gadgets for
purely artistic reasons
he's making a
statement that there
are very simple
things we rely
on in life
that we never
really pay attention
to he draws
inspiration from andy
warhol's campbell's soup cans: the way he
arranged it you
began to realise
how much art
and thought is
put into those
labels and how
actually beautiful they
look williams is
more ambivalent about
his body art
last year message
boards were buzzing
with reports that
he was spending
several hundred thousand
dollars on removing
his elaborate tattoos
through a painful
new procedure that
involves growing skin
in a test
tube but the
joke was on
pharrell-watchers I was
just kidding he
says I saw
something on cnn
and just became
lost in the
topic I didn't know it
would spin off
that it did
surely he's familiar with
the rumour mill? in a lot
of ways i'm still very
much a kid
he says a
lot of times
i don't take things
as seriously as
i need to
i'm still a
fan of music
and television and
movies and my
own brands a

up in being
much more a

lvmh which has
accumulated a 20
2 percent stake
in hermes since
october has no
intention of bidding
for its rival
a company spokesman
said last night
echoing comments made
by lvmh chairman
officer bernard arnault
who has called
lvmh's investment peaceful 
from the outset
we understood that
possibility of controlling
hermes because the
family shareholders spoke
for 70 percent
lvmh deputy chairman
pierre gode said
may 30 at
hermes's shareholder meeting
our sole objective
was and remains
to make a
long-term investment in
a company with
recognized potential and
with which we
share a passion
for high-quality workmanship hermes's
founding family
plans to retain
company and wants
lvmh to reduce
its stake by
more than half
to free shares
on the open
market bertrand puech
who heads the
family's holding company
february interview even
if lvmh doesn't reduce the
holding nothing will
change regarding the
running of hermes
puech said at
the time the
ink had barely
dried on louis
vuitton moët hennessy's takeover of
italy's bulgari – after a decade-long
courtship – when bernard arnault
the dogged boss
of the sprawling
lvmh luxury-goods empire turned
his attention back
another long
target french
rival hermès in
an interview with
le figaro arnault
the lvmh chief
executive and 46
5% shareholder said his
€3 7bn takeover
watch and jewellery
group might just
boost his chance
of securing a
deal with the
family-owned hermès –
the super-luxe business behind
the famous birkin
handbags that dangle
from the arms
of movie stars
and oligarchs wives lvmh has
built a 20
2% stake since october
– but hermès is
unimpressed and has
rebuffed arnault's overtures I
hope that this
partnership will demonstrate
that some families
are able to
understand the meaning
of a merger
with lvmh arnault
told the french
newspaper regarding hermès
i can only
repeat that we
are a peaceful
shareholder and that
we will support
the shareholders and
the strategy that
they are conducting
despite the comments
we are hearing
there or here
added arnault who
has built the
group from virtually
nothing to the
world's biggest luxury-goods empire with
60 brands through
dozens of acquisitions
in his 21
years at the
helm these brands
include haute-couture houses christian
dior and givenchy
as well as
luxury champagne grandes
marques such as
dom pérignon and
krug and fashion
labels donna karan
céline and marc
jacobs and their
acquisition has established
lvmh and in
turn france as
the undisputed leader
of the luxury-goods world analysts
say sixty-two-year-old arnault's comments to
le figaro demonstrate
just how determined
he can be
in the pursuit
of assets he
really wants he
controls the world's largest
luxury-goods group which
last year reported
a 19% surge in global
sales to a
record €20 3bn as
profits breached €4bn for the
first time meanwhile
hermès three controlling families
who collectively own
73 4% of the shares
could not have
been more dismissive
of his efforts
relationship with the
french luxury-goods company which
with barely 10% of lvmh's revenues would
hardly transform its
larger domestic rival
in the event
of a takeover
yet arnault continues
his pursuit of
hermès the paris-based maker of
birkin and kelly
bags shocked many
last week when
the chief executive
patrick thomas dismissed
arnault's stealthy acquisition
of hermès shares: if you want
to seduce a
beautiful woman you
don't start by
raping her from
behind given the
deeply offensive nature
of thomas's comment it
is perhaps ironic
that hermès a
symbol of french
gentility with bags
that fetch more
than €100 000 should
dismiss arnault also
a frenchman of
being a flash
brash american-style pile
em-cheap merchant who
would contaminate his
brand nonetheless that
is how hermès
is seeking to
portray lvmh as
fend off arnault's advances in
part through the
creation of a
holding company that
locks up a
51% controlling stake and
makes a takeover
virtually impossible as
thomas told the
last weekend: "there is a
part of our
world that is
playing on abundance
on glitz and
glamour and there
is another part
that is concentrated
on refinement basically
making beautiful objects
we don't want to
be a part
of this financial
world which is
ruining companies and
dealing with people
like they are
goods or raw
materials it's not a
financial fight because
we would lose
that it's a cultural
fight thomas adds
arnault's reputation as
a tough american-style operator it
seems is not
entirely undeserved he
is no stranger
to acrimonious bid
battles – such as the
1999 contest for
gucci in which
he lost out
to arch-rival pinault
printemps-redoute – and has a
habit of pouncing
on companies in
turmoil for example
taking advantage of
a family feud
to seize control
of chateau d'yquem one of
the greatest dessert
wines furthermore in
his own accession
to the throne
at lvmh arnault
punched his way
to the top
in an acrimonious
battle involving henry
racamier president of
business and alain
chevalier the chief
of the moët
hennessy operation and
his very first
deal in 1984
involved more than
a touch of
corporate-raider tactics with
arnault buying boussac
a struggling textile
and nappy company
that also happened
to own dior
after the buyout
arnault promptly wound
down the textile
businesses with the
loss of thousands
of jobs and
concentrated on dior
not long afterwards
arnault bought into
lvmh and by
1990 had taken
group however hermès
extreme rejection of
arnault's overtures brings
to mind the
reaction of the
bancroft family which
controlled wall street
journal-owner dow jones
upon rupert murdoch's ultimately successful
pursuit of the
us media group
murdoch completed his
turbulent $5bn takeover of
the influential financial
newspaper's publisher in
2007 like murdoch
arnault covets trophy
assets and plays
a long game
– and again like
murdoch he usually
wins one lvmh
source said: arnault would buy
hermès tomorrow if
he could otherwise
he will wait
it out even
if it takes
a generation or
two that's what he's like arnault
has not always
been successful in
addition to losing
the battle for
gucci his foray
into the auction
world was short-lived selling the
phillips auction house
in 2002 reportedly
for a multimillion-dollar loss just
three years after
buying it furthermore
europatweb an internet
investment firm set
up in 1999
by arnault with
€500m of his
own cash began
winding down in
2002 in the
wake of the
dotcom bust however
with a personal
fortune of $27 5bn – making him the
richest man in
france and the
seventh wealthiest in
the world forbes
says – and with lvmh's shares trading
at more than
double their level
a decade ago
arnault must be
doing something right
and he may
not be quite
the devil hermès
is making him
out to be
hermès like to
portray themselves as
a group of
elves lovingly handcrafting
each shoe and
arnault as a
ruthless industrialist in
fact hermès are
a lot more
industrialist than they
make out and
lvmh are more
elves-like said the
lvmh source this
view is shared
by others luca
solca an analyst
at bernstein research
said: "arnault seems to
be saying you know what
guys we've just made
an agreement with
the bulgari family
and they're comfortable with
us taking care
so why aren't you? I don't think
hermès grounds are entirely
rational they seem
afraid that lvmh
would trivialise the
brand and introduce
cheaper products I
don't think lvmh
would do that
solca adds rené
weber analyst at
bank vontobel in
zurich says: "arnault is not
afraid of a
fight and a
lot of his
battles have been
successful for him
and his shareholders
whether he can
eventually succeed with
hermès is still
an open question
he hasn't always been
successful but overall
lvmh is most
definitely a success
story lvmh the
world's biggest luxury
goods group has
raised its stake
to above 20
percent in handbag
maker hermes via
off- and on-market transactions the
french markets regulator
amf said on
tuesday lvmh reiterated
it did not
wish to seek
control of hermes
but its purchase
comes fresh on
the heels of
a defensive move
to gather the
many hermes family
shareholders stakes into a
controlling holding company
a measure which
has yet to
be approved by
the amf in
october lvmh took
the luxury world
by surprise with
the announcement that
it owned 17
1 percent of
hermes a participation
described as hostile
by hermes shareholders
and executives the
tuesday lvmh may
buy more hermes
shares separately the
regulator is investigating
lvmh's surreptitious purchase
of hermes shares
since 2008 some
through the use
of derivative instruments
known as equity
swaps which allowed
the group to
avoid having to
declare them lvmh
curt statement on
tuesday it now
owned 21 338
675 hermes shares
a stake of
20 21 percent
hermes declined to
comment on tuesday
hermes family shareholders
which number around
60 and together
hold about 73
4 percent of
the company have
called for bernard
arnault the controlling
shareholder and chief
executive of lvmh
to withdraw from
hermes's capital but
some market traders
had recently been
speculating that more
hermes shares could
be sold in
the open market
and picked up
by lvmh after
indexes dropped the
stock due to
the fall in
the market liquidity
french luxury house
hermès announced wednesday

9 percent ahead
last year's same period
revenue for 2014
came in at
4 11 billion
euros up by
10 percent noteworthy
sales in asia
grew by 13
percent despite events
in hong kong
and the general
slowdown in china's market the
company said in
fact in september
hermès opened china's first maison
hermès in shanghai
the group announced
in february that
it had surpassed
in sales with
turnover up 9
7 percent or
11 1 percent
at constant exchange

for sales growth
were north america
where sales surged

percent and europe

around 8 percent
growth at constant
exchange rates the
group said it
would propose a
5 euro exceptional dividend on top
of a regular
dividend of 2
95 euros up
from 2 70
euros in 2013
despite the outstanding
figures shares in
hermès were big
losers in europe
falling 1 9
percent in paris
after the french
luxury goods maker
said foreign exchange
rates had dragged
its margins lower
hermès has a
strong exposure to
japan highlight various
analysts following the
stock market insiders
pointed to profit-taking as well
as disappointment that
the results fell
short of expectations
nevertheless hermès will continue
its long-term development strategy
based on creativity
and maintaining control
over its know-how  the group said
in a statement
in the past
weeks one investment
analyst has rated
the stock with
a ‘sell' rating five have
given a ‘hold' rating and three

wished to remain
a long-term shareholder of
hermes and rejected
allegations it was
trying to destabilize
its smaller luxury
rival lvmh was
replying to comments
made by hermes
chairman bernard puech
who called on
lvmh to halve
its 20 percent
hermes stake and
said hermes had
been the target
of incessant attacks
in an interview
published in le
figaro on monday
lvmh which surreptitiously
built up a
stake in hermes
starting in 2008
and revealed its
move last autumn
has long been
courting hermes but
has repeatedly denied
it would like
to add the
brand to its
champagne-to-leather goods empire
as hermes was
holding its annual
shareholders meeting in paris
lvmh said it
was keen to
forge a dialogue
with hermes and
in the group's interest to
destabilize it it
would be folly
on our part
to hamper the
success of this
great brand lvmh
vice president pierre
gode said in
a statement at
hermes agm gode
added: lvmh has no
intention of aggressively
taking control of
hermes I make
the wish that
these artificial sterile
and groundless quarrels
stop to defend
itself from what
it considered a
hostile move by
lvmh hermes's controlling family
is preparing itself
a holding company
controlling more than
50 percent of
the maker of
silk scarves watches
and high-end handbags what
bothers us is
the way they
did it bernard
puech told le
figaro referring to
lvmh's stake building
so we ask
them to sell
half of their
stake to re-establish our stock
market float after
lvmh amassed hermes
shares roughly 7
percent of hermes
shares remain in
free float according
to the company's 2010 annual
report hermes shares
closed barely changed
on monday at
179 euros in
sports this is
called trash talk
said pierre-alexis dumont equity
portfolio manager at
paris-based ofi asset
management we shouldn't be reading
too much into
it hermes is
grinding its weapons
before the agm
puech dismissed efforts
by lvmh chief
executive bernard arnault
to strike a
conciliatory tone regarding
the hermes approach
after six months
we are the
target of incessant
attacks of the
kind we've never seen
in 174 years
even though lvmh
says its approach
to us is
friendly he said
with friends like
these who needs
enemies? at its agm
hermes chief executive
patrick thomas said
he expected the
group's sales growth
this year to
be good but
significantly below that
of 2010 which
was an exceptional
year christmas is
a time to
disconnect from work
catch up with
family sleep in
watch the season's most anticipated
movies eat good
food and yes
sleep it off

great opportunity to
hit the slopes

of town if
you can manage
it but despite

conditions the holidays
are not all
reindeers and fruitcake
— the stress of
holiday shopping can
take a serious
toll sweaty impatient
crowds dizzying lights and
warbling choral music
on repeat snot-nosed kids crying
for their parents
from the knees
of fake santas icy overflowing parking

things do little

there are only
whispers about what
apple's take on

could be in
development at three

the speculation is
that project titan

together at labs
in vienna austria
berlin germany and

that it's being built

into unboxing the
on-ear sine headphones
it's obvious they're a luxury
object they're solidly built
with a heavy
aluminum frame headband
and lush earcup
cushions that won't turn heads
but that feel
unmistakably expensive the
company's proprietary lightning
cable means business
too it's optional and
a major selling
point because of
the way it
cleans up audio
signals coming through
ios devices it's thick enough
that tangling isn't even a
possibility with a
large mid-cable module for
controlling volume and
advancing or pausing
tracks but that
also houses key
pass-through electronics including
a digital-to-analog converter the

balance of highs
lows and mids
was great but
the real magic
details that bobbed
to the surface

we've listened to
hundreds of times

took on new
emphasis standing out
in alt-rock crescendos as
well as lower-key jazz songs

reverse logistics company
roughly a quarter
of retail returns
take place during
the holiday season
— meaning an ill-advised purchase can
turn from bad
to worthless if
it's bought at
a store with
a strict return
policy there are
several retailers who
offer hassle-free returns with
no deadline these
include department stores
nordstrom and kohl's specialty retailers l
l bean and
lands end and home goods
store bed bath
& beyond on the
flip side apple
barnes & noble and lululemon
offer just 14
days for shoppers
to return purchases
while best buy
allows 15 days
for most products
fast-fashion shop forever
21 allows only
21 days for
returns though it
gives a little
more leeway for
online purchases sears
and gamestop allow
just 30 days
for returns and
do not accept
them without a
receipt several of
these retailers however
do extend their
return windows during
the holiday shopping
season since the
rules vary so
much from store
to store you
really have to
read the fine
print said edgar
dworsky founder of
the consumer world
online guide kevon
hills vice president
of research at
customer analytics firm
stellaservice said retailers
policies often come
down to what
type of merchandise
they're selling for
example if a
store sells highly
seasonal products that
would be out
of style if
returned a year
later it's more likely
to tighten the
time frame or
if the product
is something that
could be worn
once and then
returned — a problem known
as wardrobing — retailers often enlist
stricter standards to
cut down on
fraudulent returns for
a similar reason
electronic items such
as game consoles
are often restricted
to limited returns
dworsky said according
to the national
retail federation retailers
lost an estimated
$3 8 billion
to return fraud
last holiday season
the ability to
make easy free
returns is especially
important as more
shopping takes place
online but an
increase in returns
also results in
higher costs for
retailers particularly when
they're done for
free in a
report released just
ahead of black
friday dynamicaction found
that holiday returns
had already increased
9 3 percent
compared to the
prior season overall
returns accounted for
$642 6 billion
in lost sales
for retailers during
the year ended
in the spring
the firm said
retailers that extend
the allotted time
for holiday returns
dworsky noted others
slice and dice
their policies putting
in place different
rules for different
product categories there
are others that
provide different levels
of service depending
on whether the
shopper has their
receipt because of
such specifications shoppers
who are still
deciding where to
make a purchase
need to weigh
things like shipping
speed and price
against a retailer's return policy
hills said they
say the best
way to someone's heart is
through their stomach
so if you've procrastinated with
buying a valentine's day present
your best bet
may be to
whip up something
that not only
tugs at the
heartstrings but also
satisfies the taste
buds here are
four easy and
edible treats that
are sure to
do the trick
for the chip
lover while flowers
may be a
staple they're always way
overpriced this time
of year an
edible arrangement can
be a much
tastier and often
less expensive alternative
ketchup chip roses is one way
to go all
you'll need is
a dozen plastic
flowers chips and
some glue the
first step will
be to remove
the petals from
the fake stems
then you'll have to
reach for your
chip bag and
pick out the
curliest crisps they will form
each rose you
can surround the
centre with whatever
perfect triangles you
find now for
the glue depending
on how much
you use edibility
may be compromised
but maybe that's a good
thing? a major plus
to this gift
is your creation
can be appreciated
for longer unlike
traditional roses which
die within a
week another option
for a chip
bouquet is to
make a bigger
arrangement using bags
of chips for
the bacon fiend
you can't go wrong
with a bacon
bouquet this recipe starts the same
as the above: find some plastic
roses and remove
the stems grab
some bacon roll
it up put
a couple toothpicks
through each slice
then put the
bouquet in the
oven to bake
don't want to
fork over the
big bucks for
a fancily-cut up fruit
basket? make your own! seek some inspiration
from edible arrangements
if you're feeling ambitious
you can carve
strawberries into pretty
little roses the
internet is generally
agreed to be
a good thing

infinite choice it

you to the

buy nothing and

and grandmas around
the world if
you can no
longer justify a
homemade card and
a wilko vanilla
candle don't panic as
we've got some
seriously frugal tips
to help you
save on your
spa package dreamy
candles flowers and
even luxe cosmetics
this spring just
in time for
mothering sunday lots
of people love
the birds in
their garden but
it's rare for
that affection to
be reciprocated one
young girl in
seattle is luckier
than most she
feeds the crows
in her garden
- and they bring
her gifts in
return eight-year-old gabi mann
sets a bead
storage container on
the dining room
table and clicks
the lid open
this is her
most precious collection
you may take
a few close
looks she says
but don't touch it's a warning
she's most likely
practised on her
younger brother she
laughs after saying
it though she
is happy for
the audience inside
the box are
rows of small
objects in clear
plastic bags one
label reads: black table by
feeder 2:30 p m
09 nov 2014
inside is a
broken light bulb
another bag contains
small pieces of
brown glass worn
smooth by the
sea beer coloured
glass as gabi
describes it each
item is individually
wrapped and categorised
gabi pulls a
black zip out
of a labelled
bag and holds
it up we
keep it in
as good condition
as we can
she says before
explaining this object
her favourites there's a miniature
silver ball a
black button a
blue paper clip
a yellow bead
a faded black
piece of foam
a blue lego
piece and the
list goes on
many of them
are scuffed and
dirty it is
an odd assortment
of objects for
a little girl
to treasure but
to gabi these
things are more
valuable than gold
she didn't gather this
collection each item
was a gift
- given to her
by crows she
holds up a
pearl coloured heart
it is her
most-prized present it's showing me
how much they
love me if
form a bond
with a crow
be consistent in
rewarding them john
marzluff prof of
wildlife science gabi's relationship with
the neighbourhood crows
began accidentally in
2011 she was
four years old
and prone to
dropping food she'd get out
of the car
and a chicken
nugget would tumble
off her lap
a crow would
rush in to
recover it soon
the crows were
watching for her
hoping for another
bite as she
got older she
rewarded their attention
by sharing her
packed lunch on
the way to
the bus stop
her brother joined
in soon crows
were lining up
in the afternoon
to greet gabi's bus hoping
for another feeding
session gabi's mother lisa
didn't mind that
crows consumed most
of the school
lunches she packed
i like that
they love the
animals and are
willing to share
she says while
admitting she never
noticed crows until
her daughter took
an interest in
them it was
a kind of
transformation I never
thought about birds
in 2013 gabi
and lisa started
offering food as
a daily ritual
rather than dropping
scraps from time
to time each
morning they fill
the backyard birdbath
with fresh water
and cover bird-feeder platforms with
peanuts gabi throws
handfuls of dog
food into the
grass as they
work crows assemble
on the telephone
lines calling loudly
to them it
was after they
adopted this routine
that the gifts
started appearing the
crows would clear
the feeder of
peanuts and leave
shiny trinkets on
the empty tray an earring a
hinge a polished
rock there wasn't a pattern
gifts showed up
sporadically - anything shiny and
small enough to
fit in a
crow's mouth one
time it was
a tiny piece
of metal with
the word best
printed on it
i don't know if
they still have
the part that
says friend gabi laughs amused
by the thought
of a crow
wearing a matching
necklace when you
see gabi's collection it's hard not
to wish for
gift-giving crows of
your own if
rewarding them advises
john marzluff professor
of wildlife science
at the university
of washington he
specialises in birds
particularly crows and
ravens what food
is best? a few peanuts
in the shell
he says it's a high-energy food… 
and it makes
noise when you
throw it on
the ground so
they hear it
and they quickly
habituate to your
routine marzluff and
his colleague mark
miller did a
study of crows
and the people
who feed them
they found that
crows and people
form a very
personal relationship there's definitely a
two-way communication going
on there marzluff
says they understand
each other's signals the
birds communicate by
how they fly
how close they
walk and where
they sit the
human learns their
language and the
crows learn their
feeder's patterns and
posture they start
to know and
trust each other
sometimes a crow
leaves a gift
but crow gifts
are not guaranteed
i can't say they
always will marzluff
admits having never
received any gifts
personally but I
have seen an
awful lot of
things crows have
brought people not
all crows deliver
shiny objects either
sometimes they give
presents they would
give to their
mate says marzluff
courtship feeding for
example so some
people their presents
are dead baby
birds that the
crow brings in
gabi has been
given some icky
objects her mother
threw out a
rotting crab claw
for example gabi
points out a
heavily rusted screw
she prefers not
to touch it's labelled third
favorite asking her
why an untouchable
object is in
the favourites she
answers you don't see a crow
carrying around a
screw that much
unless it's trying to
build its house
lisa gabi's mom regularly
photographs the crows
and charts their
behaviour and interactions
her most amazing
gift came just
a few weeks
ago when she
lost a lens
cap in a
nearby alley while
photographing a bald
eagle as it
circled over the
neighbourhood she didn't even have
to look for
it it was
sitting on the
edge of the
birdbath had the
crows returned it? lisa logged on
to her computer
and pulled up
their bird-cam there was
the crow she
suspected you can
see it bringing
it into the
yard walks it
to the birdbath
and actually spends
time rinsing this
lens cap i'm sure that
it was intentional
she smiles they
watch us all
the time i'm sure they
knew I dropped
it i'm sure they
decided they wanted
to return it

10 years pursuing
any treatment that

daughter reach her highest
potential  more than anything
though ms hart
said it is
galena who has
changed eubie's life galena made her
a responsible person
 ms hart said
of eubie instead of everyone
being responsible for
her care she
now has the
responsibility for someone
else's care  they have even
taught galena to

you feel better
about yourself when
you give to
other people that's a big

mrs hartman recalled

i was just

she was telling
me her daughter
knows she is
different and has
two very social
sisters who get
a lot of
attention from other
kids the fact
that she now
has a dog
has given her
a real bright
spot in her
life the snowy peaks
tyrolean alps feed
the raging waters
of the passer
river that runs
through the town
of merano in
northern italy for
most of the
180 kilometer or
112 mile drive
from verona the
landscape is dotted
with vineyards and
spectacular medieval fortresses
carved into the
mountainside street signs
along the way
are in german
and italian a
reminder that until
the end of
world war I
the region was
part of austria
from the early
19th century onward
under austria-hungary's hapsburg emperors
meran as it
was then called
was a favored
destination of european
aristocracy both for
its dry climate
and its healing
thermal waters it
still is facing
the neo-classical structure of
the merano palace
a five-star hotel in
the center of
the town a
statue of sisi
elisabeth of bavaria
the beautiful and
fragile wife of
emperor franz joseph
i stands as
a reminder of
the town's history today
the hotel houses
the espace henri
chenot a luxury
health center catering
to an international
clientele of people
seriously interested in
their own beauty
and well-being merano is not
cannes we did
not choose this
location for its
glamour said henri chenot
a frenchman who
took over and
renovated the hotel
1980s the espace chenot
spa it is
a wellness and
detoxification center he
said we chose it
for its mild
temperatures and its
accessibility in the
center of europe
but mostly we
value the privacy
it affords our
clients the hotel
and its restaurant
are dedicated to
serving the clients
of the espace
chenot where mr
chenot applies treatments
that he has
refined over 40
years to stay young
possible and age
healthily most clients sign
up for a
week-long program in
which after a
comprehensive medical examination
and a session
with a dietitian
each is given
a personalized program
based on the
principles of biontology a health regime
devised by mr
chenot that combines
ancient chinese medicine
with advanced western
science eighty percent of
toxins are produced
by our own
organism over time
their elimination is
impaired by our
genetics and the
aging process said mr chenot
who holds doctorates
in psychology and
philosophy he holds
no medical qualification
though the center's doctors do
the daily routine
personalized to the
needs of each
client includes energetic
treatments that measure
the body's energy flows
with electric pulses
and tendon-muscle massages
hydro-energy treatments like
hydro-aromatherapy and
phyto-mud therapy sessions
are followed by
hydrojet massages a detox program
can be complicated
and the body
reacts rapidly that
is why we
provide strict control
with medical supervision
and individualized attention
mr chenot said
though many clients
come to lose
weight - a collateral effect
of the treatment
- the merano cure
is primarily marketed
as a way
to achieve a
balance between mind
and body and
reduce the long-term effects of
stress and toxicity
hypertension diabetes and
high cholesterol are
the costliest maladies
today we focus
on nutrition to
regenerate the body's vital functions
at different stages
of life mr chenot said
it is easy
to feel famished
and lightheaded for
the first two
days after a
24-hour liquid fast
followed by a
spartan regimen of
broth exquisitely presented
fruits and complex
carbohydrates served occasionally
with fish or
tofu washed down
with lemon water
or barley coffee
the restaurant offers
a sparse but
tasty cuisine devised
by mr chenot's wife dominique
a nutrition expert
antioxidant power of
nutrients rather than
calorie count this
may be italy
no sign of
parmesan cheese many ingredients are
prohibited here the
kitchen must work
within those restrictions
while following this
cleansing diet lying
out by the
pool is about
the most extreme
exercise that most
guests manage though
the center boasts
a state-of-the-art gym for
those who insist
clients do not
come here to
exercise intense physical
activity is not
recommended mr chenot said
for the hyperactive
there are walks
in downtown merano
and the botanical
gardens including those
of the nearby
trattmansdorff castle reflecting
its history merano's culture mixes
germanic and italian
to the dismay
of some of
mr chenot's clients street
vendors tout heisse
würstel and gelati
or hot sausages
and ice cream
sometimes the inevitable
happens a client here
had a cappuccino
in town one
day it was
explained to him
how it was
one he had
ever had said a waiter
in the center's restaurant according
to mr chenot
the slightest digression
from his regimen
can wreak havoc
on the body
and undo the
benefits of the
cure despite the
requirement for rigid
adherence to its
rules the espace
chenot has developed
a faithful clientele
we cater to
60 percent returning
clients our clientele
has gone from
90 percent to
40 percent italians
now we have
many french swiss
and russians often
more men than
women said sigrid auer
the center's spa administrator
and client-relations manager who
joined the chenot
team 36 years
ago even while
managing a staff
of 80 ms
auer still personally
attends to each
of the 100
guests after a
one-week program this
guest left merano
feeling genuinely healthy
invigorated and mentally
alert not to
mention measurably lighter
and full of
virtuous nutritional intentions
for the future
a six-day comprehensive program
costs €2 500 or
about $3 750 excluding
accommodations at the
merano palace compulsory
medical visits and
tempting extras like
mr chenot's line of
health and beauty
products many clients come
to us before
applying for life
insurance said mr chenot
those who have
been here see
the fee as
the price of
a new lease
on life the
holiday season is
a time both
for reflection and
cheerful celebration of
family and friendship
time for gift
giving emotionally and
materially with the
exchange of presents
affections are strengthened
and bonds renewed
doubly joyful circumstance
an occasion when
giving is as
gratifying as getting
but there are
those moments in
the bustle that
fills the festive
air in which
all of us
despair of ever
unearthing that special
something for that
special someone in
an effort to
aid in the
search and the
matching of present
to personality the
following pages offer
a variety of
suggestions a kaleidoscope
of gifts for
men women and
children they are
as practical as
a raincoat as
whimsical as a
rocking cow as
luxurious as a
diamond-and-sapphire necklace as
unique as an
18th-century danish cupboard
some are as
lasting as gold others as ephemeral
as bath salts
there is the
softness of silk
the effervescence of
champagne the sleekness
of chrome the
circuitry of electronics
the texture of
wood just as
diverse are the
price tags ranging
from $7 50 to
$98 500 inexpensive
enough to satisfy
the budget-minded and rich
enough to sate
the moneyed the
contents of this
christmastime cornucopia do
have a common
denominator however they
are all meant
to please trick-or-treating is still
weeks away but
a realistic-looking prison costume
has already tricked
the new jersey
department of corrections
and prompted the
store chain selling
the outfit to
issue a warning
to those who
buy it the
incident began on
sept 23 when
an off-duty correction officer
walking through the
cumberland mall in
vineland n j
thought he spotted
an escaped convict
at the food
court catching a
glimpse of a
man in an
orange jumpsuit with
the words department
of corrections printed
the officer who
has not been
identified had his
girlfriend call 911
when the vineland
police arrived it
took almost 40
minutes for the
man in the
jumpsuit to persuade
them that he
was the manager
of the spencer
gifts store part
of an international
chain that makes
its employees dress
up in costumes
between labor day
and halloween chris
carden a spokesman
for the department
of corrections said
the costume which
comes complete with
a set of
handcuffs posed a
risk to the
public safety  because it looked
much like the
outfit worn by
some prisoners on
work detail in
new jersey correction
officials were so
concerned about the
possibility of mistaken
identity that they
sent a telex
to local and
national law enforcement
officials warning them
not to be
fooled they have every
right to sell
it  mr carden said
but officials wanted
people to know
it looked like
a state prison
jumpsuit there is a
certain amount of
risk in wearing
it  not much but
some  by yesterday after
mr carden had
talked with the
corporate lawyer for
spencer gifts the
retailer had agreed
to take precautions
as it continues
costume at its
600 stores and
web site tracy
wain a marketing
research and strategy
analyst for spencer
gifts which is
based in egg
harbor n j
said the chain
had agreed to
send a letter
to all of
its stores instructing
employees to wear
the prison costume
only in the
store the chain
also agreed to
warn customers who
bought the costume
which sells for
$27 99 that
they ran some
it we are sending
out a communication
to our employees
in our stores
to advise customers
that the costume
could pose a
risk and that
they should wear
a jacket or
cover up when
wearing it  ms wain said
ms wain said
the costume had
been selling well
a survey of
several stores in
the area showed
that there were
costumes in stock
ms wain was
asked if she
thought the correction
officer at the
mall had overreacted
all I can
say is that
it's a little
unlikely that an
escaped convict would
be sitting at
a mall eating
lunch  she said travel
is an unavoidable
part of modern
life but when
it comes to
buying holiday gifts
choosing something travel-related is usually
not the first
thing that comes
to mind with
many new travel-friendly luxury products
on the market
this year however
there has never
been a better
time to shop
for presents that
will help friends
and family when
they are far
from home perhaps
the resistance to
buying travel items
has to do
with where they
are often sold: in-flight magazines touting
gadgets that can
be purchased by
mail order or
on the internet or the endless
corridors of airport
malls hawking animal-shaped airplane head
rests book lights
and adapter kits
- practical and necessary
items that no
one would think
to put on
a holiday wish
list then too
the pleasure has
gone out of
travel at least
for most people
in the last
few years new
airline rules - reduced size of
carry-on bags extra
charges for the
second and sometimes
first piece of
luggage and strict
limits on liquids
aboard planes - have created a
frustrating travel environment
hard times also
have driven many
travelers out of
first and business
class into increasingly
parsimonious coach still
luxury brands have
been working hard
to find ways
to lessen the
pain customization is
one way to
lend travel a
bit of cachet
again louis vuitton
has been doing
it for over
150 years creating
one-of-a-kind luggage and
trunks for its
clients early this
year the british
designer anya hindmarch
followed suit with
a store and
a collection dedicated
to bespoke items
many of which
are geared to
clients on-the-go a world
traveler herself mrs
hindmarch has created
items like luggage
tags leather carry-on totes - even a wallet
with labeled sections
for essentials like
passport and tickets
a special pocket
for luggage keys
and a space
for a personal
inscription personalized pieces are
the only pieces
that really deserve
the overused label
of ‘luxury mrs hindmarch said
about her new
collection these are the
pieces that you
cherish and hand
down to your
grandchildren the internet
has made it
easier to create
personalized travel gifts
one web site
lets customers customize
every detail of
their dress shirts
from the shape
of the collar
to the color
of the buttons
then a click
of the mouse
sends the shirt
anywhere in the
world - perhaps to a
hotel as a
perfect surprise for
a weary traveler
tight regulations on
carrying liquids aboard
planes have hit
the high-end make-up and perfume
sectors hard now
after a long
wait they are
starting to adapt
their collections the
award-winning perfumer linda
pilkington has just
released her first
collection of travel-size perfume sprays
for her brand
ormonde jayne the moment I
realized I would
have to respond
was when my
business mentor was
visiting the boutique
at the same
time as a
client who had
been asking for
travel sprays for
literally years mrs
pilkington said when the client
asked again for
the tenth time
my mentor scrutinized
my response and
without saying anything
just shot me
a particularly incisive
look and I
knew it would
have to be
done! the spray comes
in a set
of four containers
measuring 10 millimeters
or four-tenths of an
inch bigger than
sample vials but
be allowed in
a carry-on - and fit into
a clutch too
fred farrugia former
artistic director for
makeup at lancôme
started his signature
with traveling clients
in mind customers
can mix and
match white trays
that clip together
fan out for
use and stack
up for travel
there are 104
cosmetic modules available filled
with everything from
foundation and corrector
to blush lipstick
and mascara cake
a makeup case can be
adjusted to suit
any trip no
matter who the
traveler is some
items are near-universal necessities a
cashmere sweater for
example: ballantyne has teamed
up with the
designer philippe starck
to create a
collection in cashmere
treated with a
novel waterproofing technique
that makes it
even more adaptable
to a wide
range of climates
while keeping the
fabric's inimitable warmth
and lightness this
versatility comes into
its own when
traveling to several
destinations on a
single trip apple's iphone ipod
and itouch have
become must haves for
many travelers and
accessorizing them has
become big business
one brand to
jump on the
bandwagon is the
bag maker mulberry
which this month
introduced mulberry for apple
a collection of
sacs sleeves and
pouches designed for
carrying everything from
macbooks to iphones
finally what better
travel gift than
a piece of
light yet durable
luggage? luggage makers are
on an eternal
perfect mix of
style strength and
heft - a quest complicated
by ever- shrinking airline limits
on the weight
and size of
carry-on and checked
bags samsonite's cosmolite line
of impact-resistant lightweight cases
is a recent
response to the
challenge weighing just
2 4 kilograms
or 5 3
pounds for the
largest 61-centimeter or 24-inch high case
it gives a
road warrior a
fighting chance of
avoiding an excess
baggage charge appearances
can be deceiving
 which is just
as well if
your taste is
richer than your
bank account this
holiday season with
a little imagination
an eye for
quality and a
trompe l'oeil approach to
gift-giving you can
find objects  the well crafted
the artfully executed
even the occasional
work of art
 that look expensive
and feel luxurious
but don't cost an
arm and a
leg be bearer
of something that
is not only
beautiful but is
also beautifully made

chanel in havana
louis vuitton in
rio de janeiro: 'tis the season
of cruise show
controversy after all
brazil is a
land fighting an
epidemic experiencing a
maybe/maybe-not presidential impeachment
and economic malaise
and it is
under pressure for
its handling of
the upcoming summer
olympics is it
really the place
for a no-holds-barred haute european
fashion show as
vuitton held last
weekend in the
shadow of the
oscar niemeyer-designed niterói contemporary
art museum? vuitton said yes
becoming the first
european brand to
bring its catwalk
to the country
and it arrived
with its eyes
open and its
arguments mustered brazil
is among vuitton's 10 biggest
markets on the
same scale as
france germany and
russia vuitton has
had a bricks-and-mortar presence in
the country since
1989 we have been
investing in brazil
for the long-term said michael
burke its chief
executive who added
that rio was
far away from
the site of
the zika outbreak
we are not
going to drop
everything and run
at the first
sign of crisis
still conceded the
brand's artistic director
nicolas ghesquière its
executives had discussed
moving the show
but when things
are bad he
said is exactly
when you want
to show your
support and for
a fashion brand
the biggest loudest
way to do
that is to
have a show
that is live-streamed around the
world employs a
few thousand local
workers for two
weeks and entertains
approximately 500 guests
including 300 clients
from about 25
countries about half
of whom the
house brought over
there were also
celebrities like alicia
vikander catherine deneuve
jaden smith and
zendaya and they
were treated not
just to the
show but to
a helicopter ride
stand-up paddle-boarding and a
tour of local
modernist architecture among
other expeditions vuitton
is also underwriting
four exhibitions coming
to the niterói
so in some
ways the 20
minutes of runway
styles was just
the beginning and
as far as
those 20 minutes
went they were
a streamlined and
uncompromising river of
bright colors and
sporty references body-conscious
cutaways ruffles
and leather there
were dresses cut
short at the
front and swirling
long tails at
the back paper-thin leather tunics
over skinny moto
trousers graphic layers of
contemporary art references
and l k
d s — little khaki dresses
— sliced and diced
like a less
sparkly version of
the vuitton frock
taylor swift wore
to the met
gala the rib
cage and the
upper abs were
the featured erogenous
zone it is tropical
and urban at
the same time
mr ghesquière said
by telephone before
the show I had to
pay tribute to
the country we
are in but
also bring some
of paris with
me in this
mr ghesquière's third resort
offering was a
natural extension of
recent runway shows
that have happily
moved vuitton away
from the designer's original strategy
of wardrobing — a fancy word
for the kind
of basics that
form the skeleton
of a wardrobe
— and into the
realm of real
fashion: riskier but also
potentially more desirable
this was certainly
true of the
kaleidoscopic deconstructed surfer
dresses though it's hard to
imagine there are
many women out
there who want
a print of
soccer players kicking
away on their
cocktail dresses though
i could be
wrong I wasn't admittedly there
but watching the
livestream on my
computer thus I
did not feel
the embrace of
the local population
that some attendees' reports indicated but
maybe my viewing
arrangement provided some
long-range perspective when
mr ghesquière noted
that the museum
was across the
road from a
favela and the
people who lived
in the slum
would be able
to see the
show from a
stairway and their
balconies it was
hard not to
grimace after all
they were not
among the invitees
and they would
not be able
to buy what
they saw but they can
dream about it
mr burke argued
we give them
that dream and
one day they
to buy it
it's that measure
that has proved
these sorts of
risks are worth
the effort according
to mr burke
the main fashion week has
become so intense
it is virtually
impossible to hear
yourself think it's a circus
these cruise shows
hark back to
the '50s and 60s
world of couture
when clients began
a relationship with
a designer that
could last a
lifetime he said most
of the clients
the house brings
to cruise shows
immediately order pieces
from the collection
so vuitton not
only knows what
pieces will be
most popular but
the clients also
act as influencers once they go
back home each
reaching 50 to
100 friends/potential clients who
might go into
a vuitton store
and order too
all of which
means the inflation
of the cruise
season is not
going to end
any time soon
indeed mr ghesquière
said as much
noting that after
last year's cruise show
in palm springs
calif at the
modernist bob and
dolores hope estate
he realized the
engine of his
cruise shows could
be powered by
traveling for architecture
to that end
asia is still
wide open — we've never done
a show in
asia he noted
and pressure is
on for each
show to be
more spectacular and
memorable than the
last in a
more memorable venue
adding to the
potential for still
more controversies to
wit this week
gucci is to

show in the

peter owen-jones the vicar
of firle glynde

sussex recently told
the telegraph newspaper
that allowing a
fashion brand into
the building was
like selling our soul

to stow the
luggage he carries
on his continual
travels and his
job as the
men's wear at
louis vuitton which
he's held for
the past five
years is the
paycheck that lets
him indulge his
wanderlust that doesn't mean he
phones it in
any more than
that his travels
are part of
a fashion thematic
they define him
as a human
and as a
designer his restless
spirit and eye
inform what he
brings to the
workroom and so
the many journeys
he has made
over the past
year to africa
logically informed a
collection that fused
the punk clothes
and memorabilia mr
jones avidly collects
with motifs from
both traditional black
african cultures and

mr jones's success at
the house — he has produced
one unexpected hit
collection after another notably that based
on designs of
the obscure british
designer christopher nemeth
— requires a workmanlike
understanding of the
brief a vuitton
customer in dallas

has no particular
need to know
that the fine
lightweight mohair sweaters
in the show
patterned like the
skins of zebra
giraffe hartebeest or
nyala were woven
with technical yarn
and knit on
machines so expensive
that few exist
not get the
references intrinsic to
accessories like dog
collars d-rings kinky rubber

back story needed

the covetable bags
to know that
the drawings adorning
them are adaptations
by the artists
jake and dinos
chapman of early
dutch etchings that
mr jones found
at a shop

his south african
trips then again

up a bit
mr jones said
of the chapman

jones reined it
all in and
elevated the goods

golden gun at
this end of

as mr jones
has pointed out
there's an oligarch
out there for
every astronomically priced
specialty item he
cranks them out
dutifully and shifts
his attention to
more compelling aspects
of design like
finding ways subtly
to introduce punk
tartans and patterns
derived from masai
blankets into a
collection whose shapes
are otherwise safely
restricted: narrow-cut trousers shorts
safari jackets sleeveless

andrea incontri is
another of the
unsung and gifted
journeyman designers now
at work for
the past several
years mr incontri
a trained architect
has been producing
men's wear for
tod's the family-owned italian
leather-goods house based
in that country's marche region
and best known
for its gommino
shoes tod's presentation held
last week in
a pavilion set
up over the
tennis court at
the villa necchi
campiglio in milan
involved a series
of tableaux vivants
reminiscent of the
images of elegant
locals mainly nobles
photographed for italian portraits 
a volume commissioned
some years ago
by diego della
valle chairman and
owner of tod's group translated
those images embodied
the aspirational consumer
whom tod's as a
brand lays claim
to and for
whom mr incontri
implicitly designs he
interprets the casual
way rich italians
of a certain
social stratum wear
costly things by
making pricey sportswear
that looks vaguely
offhand perfectos field
jackets bombers with
low slung bellows-patch pockets linen
shirts in abstracted
leaf patterns neatly
pleated trousers and
driving shoes of
course — they all have
the quality of
something you probably
already have in
your closet or
should that is
if you are
the type of
person who actually
wears driving shoes
and not a
pair of ratty
vans to drive
down to the
hardware store about
a million universes
away from the
cozy manly lairs
that tod's created in
milan were the
scuzzy corridors and

of communal bathhouse
common in islamic
countries the actuality
closer to one's idea of
purgatory dimly lighted
labyrinthine reeking of
clorox and other
odors the place
was no deterrent
to the determined
fashion flock which
turned out in
force — crowding stairs corridors
hung with condom
dispensers and dank
cabins in each
of which a
plasticized mattress occupies
floor and they
waited and then
waited some more
as techno pounded
at earsplitting volume
until eventually the
lights flickered a
man with a
luxuriant weave wearing
stiletto heels and
a miner's lamp came
pacing through soon
series of the
lunar-complexioned models everyone
casting lately apparently
the models had
been given instructions
to stalk the
halls of the
bathhouse somewhat in
the manner of
sex hunters in
a john rechy

did with zombie
relish and it
can't have been
easy on them

the patent leather
stiletto thigh-high boots the pink shorts

designer mary l
chan puts it
plainly: it's presumptuous to
insist that customers
are going to
hand certain things
down for generations
but she continues
i'm also not
interested in designing
landfill she found
an intersection between
the too-precious and the
disposable in 2014
she made her
first handbag the
trudis tote after
failing to find
a carryall that
satisfied her exact
needs the thought behind
her subsequent leather
pieces has centered
on the experience
of going out
into the world
what do you
need to bring
with you and
how do you
need to carry
it? how do you
want to present
yourself? chan lists as
considerations and how does
the bag become
a functional object
that has a
life of its
own and lives
with everything else
in your space?much of her
effort is concentrated
on each bag's finishings the
trudis tote is
especially soft where
it touches a
person's body the brunella handbag
a rendition of
a proper ladylike
purse with a
hinged flap has
unpainted edges so
it doesn't look perfect
the hand-dyed jeanette clutch
her most popular
model is secured
using customized brass
hardware and not
custom-made since a lot of
this comes from
what i'm able to
do myself chan
says I don't have factories
because I like
making things more
than I like
researching factories in
fact she's spent seven
years in her
brooklyn navy yard
space knitting weaving
wood-turning and building
furniture as part
of her multidisciplinary
practice — while watching the
interiors industry change
and her leather
goods in particular
take off still
chan keeps only
two of each
bag style in
stock and intends
to grow the
collection on her
own terms I don't imagine that
every season i'll come out
with 15 new
bags she says
it's based on
what i'm thinking about
sometimes it's a matter
of changing color
ways the bags are
done in specific
colors because that's what looks
right to me
she adds : I don't feel like
make a plain
black leather bag
or a brown
one ever I
might do it
but i'm aware that
there's no need
for it hong kong — in a packed
bidding room last
monday christie's hong kong
hosted its 30th-anniversary auction the
tightly curated catalog
featured 30 lots
each chosen for
its desirability and
origin in categories
such as fine
art ancient ceramics
jewelry watches and
rare wines and
handbags one of
the auction's stars was
a 12-inch hermès birkin
matte himalayan crocodile
handbag with white-gold hardware set
with 245 f-color diamonds weighing
close to 10
carats with a
presale estimate of
$190 000 to
$260 000 it
was billed as
the most valuable
handbag in the
world the standing-room-only crowd mostly
from mainland china
with a smattering
of collectors from
taiwan and japan
watched with barely
bated anticipation as
jussi pylkkanen the
global president for
christie's presided from
the podium over
bidders who drove
prices for the
birkin quickly past
$128 679 in
a mere four
minutes the bag
was sold and
a record set
at $244 490 before
a buyer's premium that
an hermès birkin
fetched more money
than a hanging
scroll belonging to
the chinese empress
dowager cixi of
the qing dynasty
or a rare
solar-powered dome clock
by patek philippe
is testament to
the mythical status

main story our london office
began auctioning off
fashion items as
part of estate
sales in the
1990s and in
2000 began including
contemporary handbags as
collectors' pieces said matthew rubinger
the hong kong-based international director
accessories for asia
after a successful
stint selling bags
in online auctions
christie's opened its
handbags and accessories
departments in hong
kong and paris
in 2014 christie's now holds
twice-yearly handbag and
accessory auctions in
hong kong alongside
its more traditional
sales as to
the frenzy over
the himalayan birkin
white is the
hardest color to
achieve with crocodile
skin as you
have to remove
all of its
natural pigment mr
rubinger said of
the graduated tone
from gray to
white inspired by
majestic mountains to find a
bag in its
unused condition is
even more rare
the seller was
a private collector
who had owned
the unused birkin
since 2008 it
only one or
two of these
bags are produced
each year by
the hermès atelier
mr rubinger's job is
now focused on
sourcing the bags
for his growing
clientele and assessing
the consigned products
on a four-grade scale many
of his customers
are clients of
christie's and collectors
art but asia's affluent customers
are quickly fueling
demand continue reading
the main story
chanel has always
done well in
the secondary market
and we also
sell gucci and
balenciaga but hermès
clearly is the
leader he said
adding that the
client base is split between
asia and europe
with many repeat
customers our previous record-holder was a
35-centimeter fuchsia crocodile
birkin with diamond
hardware which sold
for 1 4
million without the
premium he said
referring to the
sale in hong
kong dollars custom orders and
exotic skins are
always popular lizard
skin is having
a moment right
now it might
seem ridiculous to
some to treat
a handbag as
an investment but
for a birkin
collector like emily
chan a hong
kong-based investment banker
it is one
worth making she
owns more than
50 of the
bags purchased as
a v I
p customer from
the paris hong
kong and tokyo
boutiques as well
as on secondary
markets via auctions
birkins are both
an investment and
a fashion accessory
to me she
said birkins are like
currency: you can cash
out any time
of all the
ways to access
the bags I like auctions
as you are
not shopping alone
she added her
favorite birkin is
unreservedly the himalayan
for the past
35 years the
birkin's price trend
has been all
the way up
performing even better
than gold said
ms chan who
began collecting in
1993 art and jewelry
are also good
investments but their
barrier to entry
is much higher
and those markets
too have volatility
and they are
not as liquid
as the birkin
birkins have climbed
in value by
500 percent in
the last 35
years an increase
expected to double
in the next
10 years according
to baghunter com
an online platform
for buying and
selling luxury handbags
this may be
why — even beyond auction
houses — a secondary birkin
market run by
a handful of
resellers has sprung
up in settings
from japan to
florida brand off's flagship store
in tokyo's ginza district
is just a
short walk from
hermès's own flagship
boutique while the
pre-eminent reseller in
paris loïc bocher
the founder of
collector square has
created the luxprice
index a referencing
chart for hermès
for watches and
jewelry with results
from about 200
000 auction transactions
he acquires his
bags from a
network of shoppers
in europe with
ties to hermès
boutiques and resells
them to customers
in the middle
east and asia
his showroom elegantly
decorated like a
home rather than
a vintage boutique
displays an array
of hermès birkin
and kelly bags
chanel's classic 2
55 handbag from our research
we know that
the asian customer
prefers the smaller
30-centimeter mr bocher
said while the european
customer likes the
35-centimeter and the
most popular colors
are beige black
and brown for
new unused birkins
we would have
a markup of
10 percent to
20 percent above
retail our customers
are always looking
for something unique
we had a
birkin so black
he continued referring
to a limited-edition style with
black hardware released
during jean paul
gaultier's tenure which we sold
within a few
hours of acquisition
collector square also
works with artcurial
an auction house
to which it
sends pieces of
exceptional quality and
rarity in the
united states privé
porter a dealer
based in boca
raton fla sold
a red crocodile
hardware last year
for $298 000 jeff
berk privé porter's founder who
had previously sold
liquidated luxury watches
started selling birkins
on ebay in
2012 we received an
overwhelming amount of
interest on the
bags he said
of the two
he sold and my wife
and I pulled
together $250 000 to
invest in our
first inventory it's been a
process of consolidation
as we started
to work with
p clientele stylists
and those who
have relatives working
at hermès to
receive a steady
supply of bags
sixty percent of
mr berk's clients are
from the united
states and 30
percent from the
asia with the
remainder from south
america he said
he has a
staff of five
and a warehouse
of about $1 5 million
in handbags there is just
something about a
birkin he said
it's like owning
a mercedes-benz: when you close
the door of
a mercedes it
sounds different than
a toyota and
that's what hermès
customers know and
buy into to
many of our
customers to own
this bag is
sense of competence
like nothing else
in 2014 robert
smith a texas
hedge fund titan
and his wife
hope dworaczyk a
playboy playmate who
appeared on celebrity apprentice requested
that mr berk
find them 30
birkins to give
away at a
staff christmas party
it took us
30 days but
we did it
mr berk said
ms dworaczyk who
is an hermès
v I p
said: I wasn't expecting them
to succeed on
the christmas party
but when I
saw the brink's truck pull
up I lost
my mind all of which
makes the fact
that wednesday's follow-up auction at
christie's included 200
handbag lots — more than half
of which were
birkins — and that handbag
sales for the
two days totaled
$5 044 890
a little more
understandable as handbags become
more easily traceable
and values continue
to increase more
collectors are seeing
their handbags as
assets mr rubinger
said even those with
no intention to
sell want to
better understand the
lasting value of
these pieces in
the tudor era
a lady-in-waiting provided noble counsel to
the queen and
could become the
king's mistress or
even after a
clutch beheading the
king's new wife
in waiting status
gave such a
woman access power
clout meaning even
to be granted
wait — to be possibly
married to the
king and maybe
subsequently beheaded — was considered a
great privilege since
those days however
not waiting — at all for
anything — has been the
far more potent
status signifier people
tell stories about
waiting if they
want to underscore
their mettle or
their patience people tell stories
about not waiting
if they want
to brag about
their wealth or
power or connectedness
they tell stories
of taking the
concorde to europe
they tell of
swift v I
p entry to
a sold-out beyoncé concert
where 45 000
commoners thronged at
the gates they
recount skipping an
endless line of
tourists at the
uffizi gallery in
florence because a
culturally influential italian
bestowed upon them
a special-access card actually
that person skipping
the line at
the uffizi was
me did I
feel so incredibly
special when I
escorted by a
uniformed docent walked
speedily past the
inert glut of
sweating humans in
the regular admission queue? I did the
high was such
that I went
to the uffizi
four times not
because I wanted
to go to
the uffizi but
to walk past
all of those
people waiting and
to watch them
watch me not
waiting not-waiting has been
brisk theater for
the inert members
of the waiting
class but on
a consumer level
the specialness of
the non-waiter has lately
started to seem
fraudulent the internet
has challenged the
belief that not-waiting is a
time dispensation reserved
for elites those
under a certain
age have never
waited for a
song to play
on the radio
or for a
show to air
on tv not-waiting is like
fast fashion — it disperses a
formerly elite advantage
among the masses
leaving the elite
to flock to
scarcity to rarity
to waiting as
in the days
of the tudors
waiting has regained
some cachet if
everything is available
at a click
what is not? for years I
heard the fashion
lore about women
on the wait
list for the
scarce supply of
birkin bags in
new york where
i live many
restaurants have begun
to refuse to
take reservations now
everyone must wait
to say they've eaten the
latest hyped-up bowl of
ramen to have
waited is now
pride as if
merely the act
of standing in
a queue counts
as noble work
any futile status
pursuit smacks a
bit of dr
seuss's sneetches those
creatures that tried
to create specialness
among their ranks
by furiously adding
or removing stars
from their bellies
but what if
delayed gratification in
the midst of
all the gluttonous
immediacy is more
than just a
trendy rebuke? could it be
an actual value
corrective? because it takes
many hours to
painstakingly hand-weave a single
yard of a
particular pierre frey
tiger-print upholstery fabric
a decorator can
be on the
waiting list for
year the list
is made longer
of course by
the simple fact
that there is
a list — we want what
others want — but that shouldn't undermine the
list's original reason
for being which
most beautiful highest-quality things cannot
be crafted quickly
and waiting like
boredom can have
an existential purpose
it can slow
down the minutes
and the hours it can arguably
like medicine extend
and even improve
your time on
earth recently I
put myself on
the first waiting
list of my
life — for a brass
choker by the
designer mona kowalska
of a détacher
when the shopgirl
added my name
to the long
list of waiting
women I felt
both sheepishly unoriginal
and oddly liberated
i just wanted
this thing it
felt so good
to proclaim my
desire — to have it
on the record
— while waiting for
the actual object
to arrive the
future suddenly gained
texture and specificity
someday in that
future I would
be wearing this
choker a few
summers ago I
listened while driving
kids around to
contemporary pop songs
songs' romantic hooks relied
on old technology
people who had
never in their
life touched a
radio dial were
singing love songs
about waiting for
songs to be
played on the
radio people who
had never used
a pay phone
sang about running
out of change
and being unable
crucial lovesick call
the immediate-gratification timetable clearly
did not or
did not yet
work for heartache-y pop ballads
yearning one of
the most poignant
shared human experiences
percolates in the
indeterminate void between
the beginning of
desire and the
end of it
time spent fantasizing
about — and sweetly agonizing
over — the object of
one's desire heightens
that desire of
course waiting can
be purely agonizing
too recently I
lost a beloved
new york tree
in a hurricane
it pained me
to realize that
if the city
planted a new
tree I would
not be alive
to see it
reach the height
of its predecessor
suddenly I was
staring death in
the face waiting
can be so
uncomfortable I realized
so seemingly worth
any amount of
money to evade
because in the
still dimly active
primitive headquarters of
our brains waiting
forces us to
reckon with the
fact that we
have only a
limited time on
earth consider a
project by the
dutch artist maarten
baas called 200 years baas is planting
a forest of
tiny saplings that
won't mature until
long after he
dies: a work of
art that won't be finished
for two centuries
if you will
be dead before
a waiting period
concludes you aren't technically waiting
for anything at
all waiting becomes
meaningless baas is
making a literal
mark on the
future that none
be alive to
witness his is
a complicated act
of artistic selflessness
and artistic hubris
but it brings
to mind perhaps
what we should
be caring about
— the future of
the world we
will leave behind
perhaps this kind
of thinking will
become the trend
in a post-waiting world as
we try to
determine what can
still make us
feel humor that's the ideology
behind skinnydip ltd
which is a
study in the
balance of opposites
— or so it
would seem — of the cool
and glam customers
its brand tends
to attract the
london-based accessories company
unveiled a collaboration
with coca-cola a first
for the companies
after a couple
of years in
talks for us we're always trying
to do something
unique and something
different and something
that's a bit
special said cofounder
lewis blitz we're also about
doing things that
are iconic and
there's no more
an iconic brand
than coca-cola the collection
includes iphone cases
bags backpacks headphones
and iron-on patches ranging
from $13 to $75 it will
asos topshop nordstrom
bloomingdale's and on
the skinnydip web
site this follows
the simpsons collaboration
last year in
what blitz called
its first mainstream collaborative effort
the two deals
thus far have
appealed to two
types of customers
the coca-cola collection as
blitz described it
appeals to a
more cool girl while
the simpsons was
really aimed at
a more glamorous
customer we look at
two main customers: the glam and
the cool girl
it's in some
ways contrasting but
in other ways
they blend together
really well blitz
said we always describe
skinnydip as fun
young eccentric and
wild we've got a
little bit of
a carefree attitude
it's banking on
that sense of
humor as it
seeks growth the
company entered the
u s market
with some surprising
finds about shoppers
here I think that
customer base has
actually been surprisingly
better for us
than we'd expected blitz
said we've really seen
customer embrace the
more novelty whacky
really eccentric product
which — being honest — we were a
little bit cautious
about ‘will people get
it in america?' obviously there's always been
that long-standing that british
humor can sometimes
be missed in
america the company
founded in 2011
is in 171
doors globally with
three skinnydip stores
in covet garden
westfield london and
off of carnaby
street plans call
for another three
stores in the
u k this
company looking at
the potential airport
locations might have
for the business
it dabbled with
the pop-up concept at
gatwick airport in
london last year
with strong sales
we'd get people
stopping taking pictures
with the products
he said we didn't really mind
that because we
were just getting
the attention that
was exciting enough
for us and
that's what we
try and do
with our stores
as well everything
we do is
about the experience
skinnydip's scouting for
u s store
locations and could
come online as
early as within
the next 18
months according to
blitz it's already begun
building the infrastructure
with an office
in new york
that opened at
the year with
possible store locations
being eyed there
in los angeles
and las vegas
skinnydip which has
more than 50
workers got its
start in tech
accessories the founders
had no previous
experienced and saw
trendy tech accessories
to get into
major retailers the idea was
always to build
a lifestyle brand
turning the fashion
industry on its
head blitz said stationery
is likely to
launch in october
with sunglasses and
jewelry to potentially
roll out in
february nothing's ever set
in stone with
us blitz said
we change we've still got
a small company
mentality we just
literally pushed back
sunglasses because they
were supposed be
july then october
we're perfectionists when
we want to
do something we
want to do
it properly lifestyle

detail the clinton
foundation will stop
receiving foreign and
corporate donations if
hillary clinton becomes
president following months
of criticism over
its donors that
has dogged mrs
clinton's election campaign
president bill clinton
who set up
the foundation in
2001 announced the
decision to staff
on thursday afternoon
and said he
would step down
from the board
if his wife
were elected to
the white house
a foundation spokesperson
said high quality
global journalism requires
investment the bill
hillary & chelsea clinton foundation
has come under
intense scrutiny since
mrs clinton launched
her white house
bid as republicans
criticise its ties
to wealthy foreign
donors and accuse
the clintons of
rewarding money with
access the republican
party which has
used the foundation
as fodder for
its argument that
mrs clinton cannot
be trusted described
the former president's announcement as
too little too
late the news emerged
as donald trump
mrs clinton's republican rival
appeared to concede
that his campaign
rhetoric had been
too divisive saying
at his first
rally since shaking
up his campaign
this week that
he regretted some
of his remarks
questions over mrs
clinton's relationship with
foundation donors while
secretary of state
have created a
cloud over her
campaign along with
controversy over her
use of a
private email server
when mrs clinton
was at the
state department she
agreed to keep
foundation matters separate
from her duties
but emails released
last week revealed
seemingly close contact
between mrs clinton's aides and
foundation officials the
foundation will continue
to accept donations
from us citizens
and independent charities
even if mrs
clinton wins the
election mr clinton
also told staff
on thursday that
he would stop
giving paid speeches
were elected president
and that the
foundation would end
its annual clinton
global initiative gathering
regardless of who
won in november
reince priebus chairman
of the republican
national committee said: this effort to
shield hillary clinton
and the clinton
foundation after more
than a year
of controversy is
late after all
if everything was
above board while
hillary clinton ran
the state department
as the clintons
have said then
why change a
thing? but now that
they have admitted
problem the clinton
foundation should immediately
cease accepting foreign
donations and return
every penny ever
taken from other
countries several of
which have atrocious
human rights records
and ties to
terrorism high quality global
separately mr trump
struck a new
tone at his
rally in north
carolina saying: sometimes in the
heat of debate
and speaking on
a multitude of
issues you don't choose the
right words or
you say the
wrong thing I
have done that
and I regret
it particularly where
it may have
caused personal pain
too much is
at stake for
us to be
consumed with these
issues mr trump overhauled
his campaign earlier
this week by
promoting kellyanne conway
a veteran republican
pollster to campaign
manager and appointing
stephen bannon the
head of the
conservative breitbart news
as chief executive
the new york
tycoon appeared to
attempt to pivot
towards being more
presidential but critics
pointed out that
mr trump in
the past has
temporarily shown signs
of being less
controversial before reverting
to his more
abrasive style in
response to his
comments christina reynolds
deputy communications director
for the clinton
campaign said: donald trump literally
started his campaign
by insulting people
he has continued
to do so
through each of
the 428 days
from then until
now without shame
or regret we learned tonight
that his speech
writer and teleprompter
knows he has
much for which
he should apologise
but that apology
tonight is simply
a well-written phrase until
he tells us
which of his
many offensive bullying
and divisive comments
he regrets — and changes his
tune altogether alexander mcqueen always
made handbags to
die for but
would he approve
of one that
he could have
literally died for? hopefully he would
because an artist
wants to make
a leather handbag
using the designer's skin tina
gorjanc from central
saint martin's art school
has produced a
project complete with
patents describing plans
to use dna
extracted from mcqueen's hair to
make his skin
in a laboratory
using cutting-edge biotechnology at
present growing enough
skin to craft
a full handbag
would probably be
prohibitively expensive although
arguably not compared
with what mcqueen
who died in
2010 used to
charge…in april elle
writer justine harman
spotted a classic
nylon box-shaped kate spade
bag on ebay
the bag she
noted was knocked
down from its
original price of
$250 to a
staggeringly low $39 99 while
this discovery delighted
some millennial women
who grew up
begging their parents
for one of
these handbags others
might have noticed
that this dramatic
price dip is
indicative of something
bigger: the designer handbag
industry is losing
its luster as
with all trends
there's an ebb
and flow not
everything can stay
relevant forever kate
spade has adjusted
to a more
colorful bright fun
look but the
company's offshoots kate
spade saturday targeted
towards millennials and
jack spade which
tapped into the
men's industry shuttered
all their doors
in the winter
the wall street
journal reported in
april bloomberg noted
that michael kors
was the top
handbag for teens
replacing coach kate
spade was in
third place but
michael kors sales growth has
been eroding and
prospects do not
look good for
the brand the
brand's inventory has
risen suggesting that
the brand's products aren't flying off
shelves michael kors
rose to popularity
because of its
handbags facebook it
might be because
too popular — or too widely
purchased this is
in part due
to the presence
of outlets — which michael kors
has aplenty — which can ultimately
be brand killers
outlets devalue a
brand encourage people
to not buy
at full price
and make luxury
items too accessible
further widespread popularity
is the kiss
of death for
trendy fashion brands
particularly those positioned
in the up-market younger consumer
sectors industry expert
robin lewis wrote
on his blog
lewis compares michael
kors to tommy
hilfiger which reached
its peak in
the late 1990s
michael kors is
considered an aspirational
brand with consumers
paying a premium
for its label
once everyone has
the product it
considered cool other
brands that have
experienced this phenomenon
include juicy couture
jordache and coach
— which michael kors
dethroned as the
most popular high-end handbag brands
for teens as
bloomberg has reported
but coach's woes are
undeniable cnbc reported
the bizarre disparity
for coach: sales still dipped
amid shares rising
on a recent
earnings call ceo
victor luis attributed
this to how
been cutting back
on flash sales
sweeping up shoe
brand stuart weitzman
at least helped
slightly the acquisition of
stuart weitzman in
early may contributed
$43 million to
fourth-quarter and full-year revenue cfo
jane hamilton nielsen
said on the
call but it
might not just
be handbags that
are at a
loss this pattern
is indicative of
a much larger
trend after all
millennials spend their
money differently than
the generations preceding
them did old-school retailers like
gap have suffered
compared to fast-fashion companies like
zara and h&m which allure
millennials with their
quick turnaround and
low-price traditional retail
has been struggling
as a result
and those traditional
retailers who attempt
to cater to
millennials instead of
baby boomers or
gen xers face
huge possible risks:
millennials don't spend that
much money as
it is saddled
with debt this
generation isn't spending money
on luxury items
and by alienating
consumers who do
have money retailers
inadvertently put themselves
in a precarious
situation who will
buy from them? hilary stout illustrated
this problem in
times in june: after all the
millennial generation has
less wealth and
more debt than
other generations did
age thanks to
student loans and
the lingering effects
of the deep
recession she wrote
and forrester researchers
highlighted in a
study that baby
boomers between the
ages of 51
and 69 are
the biggest spenders
because they have
extra cash from
decades of saving
and investing — something millennials just
can't afford additionally
millennials are flat
out not spending
on apparel a
study by morgan
stanley highlighted that
millennials are instead
choosing to spend
money on expenses
like rent cellphones
and services macy's cfo karen
hoguet even blamed
netflix on the
sales slumps I
think part of
that is the
customers are buying
other things whether
the electronics cable
services netflix whatever
hoguet said ultimately
there's a limited
market for selling
clothing — let alone designer
handbags the biggest
threat to the
industry could be
henrys — a term luxury
expert pam danziger
coined standing for
high earners not
rich yet these
people make over
$100 000 and
as she told
bloomberg are making
very careful decisions
to spending but
because they're not picking
up designer products
the luxury brands
are feeling the
burn today those
people feel decidedly
middle class and
not at all
luxury class danziger
told marketplace org
which begs the
question — why buy luxury
items? especially when you
can sweep your
favorite items from
the aughts on
ebay for under
$40 then again
while some of
kate spade's bags are
relics of the
past on the
internet its more
fashion-forward bags are
thriving — proving that the
handbag industry can
in fact save
itself from an
ominous fate in
wholesale our business
was primarily driven
by strong performance
in handbags with
data showing a
continuing increase in
market share representing
a key opportunity
for growth as
we build on
our still modest
penetration of market
share ceo craig
leavitt said on
a recent earnings
call for the
company nearly half
of nordstrom inc
stores stopped selling
the line of
michael kors handbags
branded michael during
the month of
may according to
a tuesday note
from wedbush the
bank said it
spoke with 112
handbag managers in
and canada for
its latest report
another five stores
said they are
planning to discontinue
sales of the
designer bags in
the next few
weeks the note
said it comes
a week before
michael kors holdings
ltd kors +1 05% reports its fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings we heard from
a few managers
that more stores
would be phasing
the brand out
by the end
because of waning
interest from customers
macy's m -0 40% constant discounting of
kors' product analysts wrote
other sources said
michael kors was
the number one
returned handbag brand
because of poor
craftsmanship and they
were not surprised

united states — coach inc chief
executive officer victor
luis has a
strategy to make
the brand more
edgy and cool: a cheeky mickey
mouse sticking out
his tongue facing
an industrywide slump
coach is slapping
the walt disney
co character on
its leather goods
plan to enliven
the brand with
pop-culture icons and
create more limited-edition products the
idea is to
give shoppers another
reason to buy
a new handbag
— and coax them
into paying full
price for it
since the worldwide
launch of the
disney handbags on
june 17 several
of the items
have sold out
online including all
four colours of
the $395 kisslock handbags
that are designed
in the shape
of mickey's ears large
$1 500 leather
mickey mouse dolls
and bean bags
also have sold
quickly we've been very
pleased with any
time that we've engaged with
fashion that's been in
a much more
limited emotional inspirational
way luis 49
said in an
interview you can certainly
look forward to
us having other
collaborations go forward
turnaround plan coach
is trying to
restore its cachet
after mounting competition
sluggish demand and
heavy discounting led
to two years
of declining sales
the new york-based company has
released fresh products
and designs from
creative director stuart
vevers aiming to
win back customers
from kate spade
& co and michael
kors holdings ltd
coach's earnings growth
rebounded last quarter
and luis is
cutting costs as
part of his
turnaround effort the
stock has gained
22 percent this
year outpacing the
1 5 percent
gain of the
standard & poor's 500 index
the shares were
little changed in
new york on
thursday trading at
$39 85 selling
limited-edition items such
as the disney
products helps ensure
that they do
not end up
in the discount
bin said michael
binetti an analyst
at ubs group
ag they have
more scarcity value he said and
the strategy is
a better way
to increase traffic
than just offering
coupons and promotions
binetti said new
york attitude coach
also is counting
on american pop
culture to make
its brand more
enticing to overseas
buyers and foreign
tourists luis said
celebrating its 75th
anniversary this year
and aims to
play up its
new york heritage
with a new
flagship store on
fifth avenue the idea of
american dream and
the idea of
new york and
anything is possible
opens up the
world of opportunity
to international consumers
luis said but
it is hard
to tell how
much mickey mouse
bags and other
novelty products can
lift the coach
brand though vevers
designed the disney
items to be
edgy and sophisticated
they may have
less appeal to
domestic shoppers than
to foreign tourists
and the strong
dollar has made
products from us
companies a tougher
sell the ultimate
problem for coach
is its heavy
reliance on handbags
which make up
80 percent of
its sales said
christian buss an
analyst at credit
suisse group ag
that category is
still in a
slump he said
purse problems we are really
concerned about slowing
growth in the
handbag category in
north america buss
said if the category
isn't growing and
the category isn't healthy it
will be much
more challenging for
coach to turn
around its earnings
coach also gets
60 percent of
its sales from
outlets according to
buss that makes
it hard to
wean the company
off discounting and
burnish the brand
vevers's coach 1941
line named after
the founding year
is an attempt
to get back
company's glamour it
has helped coach
increase distribution from
some department and
specialty stores and
get into retailers
that it has
not been in
before in turn
the company may
reduce its exposure
to some lower-tier stores luis
said coach's efforts to
modernise the brand
with new products
and marketing are
still in the
early stages he
said it's kind of
endless — you can't say we're finished luis
said there's still a
tremendous amount to
do the brainchild
of designer paul
costelloe the eponymous
label was launched
in 1979 since
then it has
built a significant
following for its
garments – made with luxurious
fabrics nuanced by
british design and
creativity – with the design
aesthetic hinging on
unique handcrafting and
tailoring techniques 
with nearly 40
years under his
belt costelloe has
carved a niche
for himself as
one of britain
and ireland's noted names
in the fashion
industry during his
career spanning over
three decades costelloe
has designed uniforms
for british airways
and uniforms for
the irish olympic
team in athens
greece his ss16
collection new reflections is a nod
to the 60s
and features neoprene
fabrics in bright
palette that bring
to the fore
strong elements of
tailoring through statement
sharp coats playful
jumpsuits and a-line dresses what
inspired your ss
rtw? it was a
real nod to
the 60s and
the time of
courrèges I experimented
with neoprene fabrics
in bold colors
but still incorporating
my philosophy for
supreme tailoring I
manufacture most of
my collections between
the uk and
italy the italians
have a natural
understanding for tailoring
and fabrics so
this collection was
fun to work
on what kind
of creative outlets
help you create
each collection afresh? I travel constantly
i reinvent myself
and my collections
every season and
the inspiration always
comes from a
different source going
to the fabric
fairs and trade
shows shows me
what colors and
materials are coming
in but being
aware of other
creative outlets be
it photography film
or art are
big sources of
inspiration what tips
would you offer
to aspiring designer? I see a
lot of graduates
who come out
of college thinking
they have everything
they need to
succeed but in
many cases the
basic skills are
very undeveloped don't start out
thinking you're going to
be a fashion
designer – learn to draw
learn to make
a toile learn
to sew learn
about fabrics learn
about finance whatever
it is with
any of these
skills you can
make it in
the industry maybe
you won't be able
successful brand but
if you have
those skills you
will always be
in demand how
important is practical
experience for a
designer? extremely important! at the end
it's a combination
of natural talent
and then developing
that talent in
a real work-environment which really
gives that confidence
and knowledge to
take on your
own brand or
label understanding all
the facets of
the design manufacturing
and retail process
is essential – from understanding fabrics
and materials to
knowing the best
regions for manufacturing
different garments and
having a clear
idea of where
you want your
product to sit
this all takes
time there is
something so powerfully
feminine about the
scents prints and
fabrics from these
collections with a
spritz of perfume
slipping on a
delicate heel the
ritual of getting
ready can be
something so special
and satisfying mediterranean
honeysickle by aerin
is a deeply
beautiful perfume reminiscent
of the perfect
summer afternoon dolce
& gabbana gives us
a way to
feel immediately glamorous
for a night
out on the
town while carolina
herrera is an
eternal favorite for
classic tailored looks
the wildly dior
sunglasses are reminiscent
of a modern
audrey hepburn – even in jeans
and a favorite
t-shirt all of
these pieces are
lasting investments bringing
many moments of
joy wherever you
live and whatever
you are drawn
to remember to
take a few
moments for yourself

luxury around you

humble beginnings: a garage in
st louis in
1969 a year
when anything was
possible but his
passion for design
and sourcing resulted
in a product
that would evolve
from the midwest
to stretch across
the globe: english brass french
calfskin manufacture in
the hills of
tuscany we take pride
in designing the
perfect buckle selecting
the choicest leathers

fine-jewellery designer roberto
coin's ode to
august is a
new capsule collection
inspired in parts
by nature and
china featuring the
birthstone of august
– the glamorously green
peridot – roberto translates his
fascination for china
and its luxuriant
peaceful gardens into
his new shanghai
collection i've always been
fascinated by this
asiatic city and
wanted to create
a collection characterized
by a timeless
elegance with asian
influences says roberto
shanghai collection by
roberto coin the
precious and beautiful
color of peridot
becomes a perfect
fit for this
new line as
oval pear-shaped and round
gemstone clusters form
a veritable garden
of greenery while walking through
my private gardens
i find the
same peace and
inspiration as in
an asian garden
there are more
shades of green
than one can
imagine and these
are the shades
that i've reinterpreted through
the precious stones
in this collection
the designer adds
shanghai rings earrings
and bracelets feature
dual shades of
green combined with
sparkling diamonds – light-hued peridots nestle
with contrasting darker-hued tourmalines the
result is an
enchanting play of
green that evokes
the dance of
sunlight as it
filters through the
branches and leaves
creating patterns of
light and shade
on the foliage
go green this
august! shanghai collection by
roberto coin2016 is
the year of
the monkey in
the chinese zodiac

sign are said

intelligent what's not to
love about these
traits or the

use for graphic
attitude admittedly we
love it too
the monkey bejeweled

largest privately held
diamond-mining corporations – recently
paid homage
to the hollywood
star jane seymour
obe by naming
a 2 08
carat fancy vivid
blue cushion-cut diamond ring
after her seymour
is best known
for her role
as bond girl
solitaire opposite roger
moore in ‘live and let

committee of the

this occasion seymour
was also gifted
her birthstone – a rare 21
61carat amethyst the
jane seymour blue
diamondthe jane seymour
blue diamond this
unique ring is
part of the
group's private collection
the invitation to
behold this creation
would rather you
not compare the
jane seymour to
anything else in
the high jewelry
world says karan
tilani director world
of diamonds group
celebratory treat more
comparable to a
mega-yacht or a
ticket to the
moon a primary
reason for using
platinum as the
material of choice
is owing to
its enduring quality
which in many
ways embodies seymour's spirit the
floral motif is
inspired by erodium
malacoides commonly known
as the mediterranean
stork's bill in
november last year
a 12 03
blue moon diamond
sold for $48 468 158

new record at

that such rare
diamonds as the
jane seymour are
highly covetable moreover

diamonds and of
that mesmerising saturation

us $2 000 000
at auction houses
like christies and
sotheby's the jane
seymour blue diamondthe
jane seymour ring
is the only
celebrity ring that
isn't pre-owned the search
is on for
an owner for
this exquisite jewel
which comes with
an eye-watering price tag
but even if
someone were happy
to pay that
kind of money there is a
catch the connoisseur must
also fulfill certain
criteria established at
the discretion of
wod's chairman explains karan fitting
into the shoes
of someone as
elegant down-to-earth and talented
like seymour for
sure is a
tall order who
will own the
diamond ring? we shall wait
and watch are
you a self-confessed hipster a
flowery bohemian or
a sophisticated woman? of course we
are all unique
snowflakes in our
own way and

a soft spot
for a particular
fashion tribe that
speaks to us

the term capsule wardrobe is commonly used
media but what does
it really mean? in the beginning
the term capsule wardrobe was
coined by susie
faux owner of
the west end
boutique wardrobe in the
1970s to refer
to a handful
of essential fashion
items of clothing
that would never
go out of
fashion and could
be worn for
multiple seasons the
idea was to
update this with
accessories and seasonal
pieces to provide
something to wear
for any occasion
without buying many
new items of
clothing the capsule
wardrobe concept was
popularised in the
states by designer
donna karan in
1985 when she
released her 7 easy pieces
collection this showed
eight models dressed
only in bodysuits
and black tights
strutting down the
runway the models
then began to
add items of
clothing such as
wrap-skirts trousers and
dresses to demonstrate
her interchangeable style
of dressing since
then several tv
shows including trinny
and susannah‘s ‘what not to
wear' and gok's fashion fix
have highlighted how
a capsule wardrobe
is an especially
important tool for
those who are
trying to save
the environment wardrobe
space – and money! while susie faux
suggests that a
woman's capsule wardrobe
contain at least
2 pairs of
trousers a dress
or a skirt
a jacket a
coat a knit
two pairs of
shoes and two
bags we think a
bit more may
be needed for
a full wardrobe
the general rules
to get the
perfect capsule wardrobe
first think about
these points: choose your colour
scheme this would
typically involve choosing
one or two
base colours that
go with everything
it could be
a monochrome wardrobe
based on black
white and navy
or one in
warmer tones of
cream camel and
brown staple items
like trousers handbags
or coats would
be bought in
shades of these
colours so that
they can be
mixed and matched
with anything else
in your wardrobe
after choosing your
base colours it's time to
select one or
two accent colours
which should be
brighter than and
co-ordinate with the
base these would
typically be used
for items such
as tops dresses
or accessories once a colour
scheme is established
all the items
in a wardrobe
should be fully
interchangeable making dressing
simple! consider your body
shape some cuts
of clothing are
more flattering than
others for example
wrap style dresses
suit just about
every figure as
adjusted to every
body type most
stylists often advise
that women with
wider hips wear
cap sleeves as
they make the
shoulders appear wider
and more proportionate
to the hips
a large bust
you may not
bulky knits if
you pick clothing
that's flattering you'll want to
wear them a
lot more right? consider your complexion
as with cuts
of clothing some
colours are more
flattering than others
to both skin
tone and body
shape if your
skin is super
pale or dark
choose cool colours if you have
a bit of
golden undertones choose
warmer tones choose
classic shapes and
patterns – or better yet
few patterns at
all while some
cuts and patterns
of clothing go
in and out
of fashion others
are considered ‘classic'
because they don't date animal
prints generally come
and go with
regularity as do
basic florals but
remember when stella
mccartney did those
big fruity prints? they look a
bit dated now
as do the
‘bling bling' chain prints from
the 80s at
versace keep it
simple: stripes polka dots
tiny flowers or
animal prints are
ok in small
quanities think of
french girl chic: the breton stripes
are an eternal
classic but generally
the french don't ‘do'
prints – and their wardrobes
stay evergreen for
decades choose high-quality fabrics some
great fabrics like
silks and leathers
look even better
with age and
dea of a
capsule wardrobe is
to own a
few items of
clothing that can
be worn different
ways individual pieces
get lots of
wear therefore it
is a good
idea to choose
clothing that is
well made and
continues to look
good despite wear
the essentials here
are the 13
essentials we think
you'll need and
where to get
them sustainably a
classic trench or
swing coat these
both suit any
figure and seem
to be eternally
in fashion both
styles can be
done in wool
or alpaca for
colder weather or
canvas or organic
cotton for when
it's a bit
warmer eileen fisher
makes wonderful coats
of all kinds: swing trench military
you name it
and the best
part? this 100% sustainable
designer's perfect capsule
pieces are available
internationally online or

stores around the
world dennis basso
is a larger
than life character
he is full
of style that
transcends from fashion
to the décor
of his homes
to the legendary
dinners that he
hosts in the
hamptons he designs
some the most
exquisite fashion of
our era from
the dreamy light
blue bridesmaid's dresses for
nikki hilton's wedding at
kensington palace to
his anticipated fashion
week shows each
year he has
the star qualities
of a glamorous
hollywood: the great laugh
impeccably tailored clothing
and the feeling
that whenever you're speaking with
him he is
perpetually en-route to something
fabulous – but he makes
time for people
and waxes poetic
about whatever it
is you want
to discuss dennis
basso his pre-fall 2016 collection
is in a
word: majestic perfectly in
line with the
bohemian wave of
beauty in interior
design and artisan
made goods throughout
the west coast
the collection had
a most fanciful
incarnation with his
low almost conspiring
voice he tells
the story of
his inspiration i've done enough
fashion coverage to
hear stories of
inspiration often circling
around an idea
of the new
modern woman but
dennis changed the
landscape literally dennis
basso speaking on
his inspiration he
says were in a
field – and there's this enormous
tree where there's this marvelous
party at an
old country manner
home he begins
it's a hazy
glamorous affair where
the women are
dressed to the
nines in these
flowing almost bohemian
gowns wildflowers are
everywhere the moon
the flowing fabric
is all captured
from this image
fabulous indeed back
mentally from the
manner estate he's now at
the madison avenue
flagship store prepping
these dresses for
fashion week and
talking about all
things beauty- from inspiration to
dinner and what
makes a stylish
man and woman
today: how do you
begin your day? oh I try
to do two
healthy things right
away I eat a
good breakfast and
work out with
my trainer then
i'm talking with
my team about
the collection and
checking in on
all we are
accomplishing for the
day ahead lunch
is a wonderful
opportunity to communicate
for work or
catching up with
a dear friend
i always make
time to enjoy
this dennis basso
you travel everywhere
and have managed
life that seems
so in-tune with who
you are in

home into my
work speaking of
home I need
to pause a
moment on your
collection of blue
and white porcelain
i know it's marvelous and
my home makes
me very happy
it's very us
me and michael
dennis basso does

a story? i'm very much

piece has come
from we travel

vast collection from
asia also wonderful
glass wear from
turkey a collection

idea to pop
into your favorite
antique store and
see what you

100 people have
a similar vein
of casual perfection
– the place settings
candles flowers what

kitchen together on
many occasions dennis
basso even at
a casual party
the silver tea
service is out
i love that
we don't believe in
storing anything! everything is used
and enjoyed nothing is kept
in a cupboard

appealing and stylish

to be well
kept that is
style caring and
making an effort

from all who

now taking center
stage as my
favorite it footwear is
tosaly's kamaria heel conceived
by the well-heeled luxury british
designer toyin salami
the kamaria is
a tried-and-true statement shoe
handmade by master
artisans using modern
techniques fine italian
leather and traditional
british craftsmanship—as are all
haute tosaly shoes
and handbags the
heeled kamaria sandal
priced at $737 55 is
sophisticated yet sexy
and highly versatile
working with everything
from evening wear
to jeans the
shoe is predominantly
comprised of a
stunning midnight black
suede leather that's accented with
a serpentine-esque accent of
black snake print
patent leather that
gives it just
the right amount
of edge shoe
laces slither up
the entire outer
topside of the
beautifully laser cut
opening from the
toes all the
way up to
the ankle in
a crisscross pattern
that makes the
contrasting exposed skin
aesthetic all of
this fabulosity is
perched atop an
elegant slim heel
just over 5
6 inches high
as with all
tosaly shoes the
sole of the
kamaria heels features
the brand's signature black
and white checkerboard
leather that serves
as a distinctive
and instantly recognizable
trademark this attention-getting patterned sole
is specially made
in spain from
leather that's painted in
bright glossy black
and white checkered
squares which further
enhances the uniqueness
and visual appeal
of the footwear
and while the
tosaly heels are
certainly killer they
are quite forgiving
on the feet
since they are
well-padded and lightweight
toyin describes her
collective shoe designs
as classic with a
twist' which the kamaria
heels certainly are
so totally in is tosaly
the shoe line
is garnering attention
from major celebrities
rihanna has reportedly
taken a bold
liking to the
company's isabis heels in
colorful contrast to
the all-black kamaria tosaly's isabis heel
is beautifully outlined
with blue damask
also featuring a
patent pink leather
trim and a
gold buckle they
would definitely rock
the red carpet…or your own
night out on
the town as
well beyonce and
actress lupita nyong'o both reportedly
own tosaly masterpiece
totes toyin founded
tosaly in 2012
with the idea
of cultivating a
brand that highlights
individuality and female
empowerment and by
my measure she's hitting the
mark if you're a style-seeker who likes
to play it
safe this line
is not for
you tosaly's kamaria and
other shoe styles
are for confident
fashion-forward women who
are not afraid
to stand out
from the crowd
in fact they
prefer to guilty
party of one
high jewelry is
the magical kingdom
of superlative jewelry
and exceptional stones
– a realm filled
with imagination and
passion which brings
together the many
trades to create
unique pieces capable
of combining emotions
a contemporary spirit
tradition firmly rooted
in geneva goes
dawn of the
renaissance indeed genevan
goldsmiths and jewelers
were renowned all
over europe as
early as four
centuries before the
first jewelers were
established on the
place vendôme with
roots like these
one can nurture
big dreams perpetuated
from generation to
generation with the
acquisition of new
craftsmanship know-how this tradition
of beautiful personal
adornments has continued
right through to
the present day
with ateliers such
as de grisogono
the creation of
an exceptional piece
is generally born
from the encounter
between an inspiration
and a gemstone: it stems from
the vision of
a designer like
fawaz gruosi a
brand like de
grisogono capable of
thinking in terms
of volumes reflecting
the nuance of
colors and drawing
in tune with
light de grisogono
takes each initial
design idea and
transcends them by
turning each piece
into a glistening
reality after a
first sketch comes
the preliminary drawing
which the atelier
will craft into
a three-dimensional piece combining
the precious metal
of the mounting
with the precious
carats of the
stones chosen it
is this unique
fragile almost ethereal
procedure that is
the foundation of
the legitimacy and
timeless value of
our contemporary creations
the beauty of
de grisogono's jewelry is
not only shown
on the visible
side but even
when the concealed
side of a
jewel remains out
of sight this is something
that women adore
because it is
pure luxury made
just for them
this is all
part of de
grisogono's quest for
excellence and there
are no limits
on the journey
to achieve the
final masterpiece the
same passion and
attention to detail
that exists in
the creative process
of a high
jewelry piece is
transcended into our
jewelry collection the
same quality of
stones and exact
outstanding craftsmanship used
in high jewelry
are used to
develop our jewelry
collections such as
allegra boule chiocciola
matassa melody of
colors among others
fawaz gruosi's vision to
create the unique
high jewelry pieces
inspired him to
develop these amazing
creations that are
made available to
our exclusive clientele
around the globe

took 5 minutes
out of her
schedule to talk
all things jewelry
with us… when did you
decide you wanted
to go into
jewelry design? how did it
all start? I started working
for a fine
jewelry designer in
nashville tn while
going to school
at belmont university
i'd stay in
her studio till
midnight just banging
way on metal
and catching things
on fire making
as much jewelry
as I could
for myself and
her customers I
fell madly in
love I started
selling my pieces
off my neck
and at that
point I knew
i needed to
start my own
business what is
your earliest memory
of jewelry? playing dress up
in my moms
jewelry box at
the age of
six I would
put all her
big rings on
each finger it
made me feel
fabulous! you work a
lot with precious
stones what are
you favorite materials
and why? I love working
with different fossils
and geodes my
favorite stones are
pyrite labradorite and
sleeping beauty turquoise
i also love
working with wax
and casting pieces
from nature what
item of jewelry? my favorite item
of jewelry would
be my original
luida cuff bracelet
it has the
most beautiful black
geode crystal i've ever seen
before on it
i've tried to
sell it but
every time I
try I end
up wanting it
for myself I
also love my
flame 14k rose
gold ear jacket
i never take
it off! how does the
design process begin? I keep a
sketchpad on me
so that whenever
inspiration hits I
am ready I
have a sketch
pad on my
night table so
that anytime I
have a design
of of the
night or early
morning I draw
it out after
i draw out
the design I
start forming it
in wax or
send it to
my metal castor
in nyc and
she has it
made for me
what are the
inspirations behind your
designs? celestial nature sea
life and all
things spiritualitywhat would
you say is
your signature piece? my big geode
druzy rings…the bigger the
better! I would also
say my geode
slice lariat necklaces
it's called liz
all of my
pieces are named
after my family
what's in store
for next season? i'll be spending
months in bali
thailand new zealand
and australia while
traveling and doing
yoga I expect
plenty of inspiration
while i'm there do
you have any
advice for anyone
who wants to
go into jewelry
design? follow your passion! know what your
genius is and
learn to let
others do their
genius it makes
a huge difference! stay in your
own authentic style
to design…be an artist
not imitator geneva-based arlène bonnant
worked in the
world of art
for over a
decade and was
thus surrounded by
some wonderful artists
they came up
with wondrous works
inspired by their
desire to create
– and this seemed
to have rubbed
off on arlène
in their midst
arlène's desire to
create became ever
so strong that
she took to
jewelry designing while
focusing her attention
on crafting what
she describes as
jewelry with significance
and not just
decorative objects but
wonders with depth
and that is
how the brand
was born nearly
five years ago
so what significance
does the word
caspita hold for
arlène? caspita is an
injunction halfway between
surprise and marvel
explains the designer
i like the
sound of it
on a more
intimate note my
grandfather whom I
adored used this
italian expression whenever
i amused him
with incredible tales
this was at
a time when
he was very
old and I
was just a
little girl she
says walking down
memory lane arlène's love for
her grandfather prompted
her to name
the jewelry line
caspita with its
ethos hinging on
the notions of
ornaments for the
mind and conversations
for the soul
through her collections
arlène endeavors to
translate the abstract into
something a lot
more meaningful and
precious a look at
her collection tells
you that she
has translated the
abstract concepts effectively
so into lovely
pieces of jewelry
inspired by the
beauty of universal
quests and its
metaphysical iconographies the
designer combines harmony
with beauty while
fostering spiritual equilibrium in each of
her pieces an
offshoot of this
quest is her
tourbillon ring consisting
of seven shapes
that represent the
seven chakras – each of which
rotates while being
layered I had the
color version in
mind funnily enough
we received an
award at couture
la for that
piece she recalls
arlène's focus on
talismanic jewelry and
design stems from
her passion for
primary traditions which
bind together myriad
cultures and people
i am fascinated
by symbols and
more generally by
iconography she adds this
fascination soon led
to the chakra
series colors says
arlène are fundamental
to her life
chakras she observes
are the quintessence
of those different
aspects – they move shimmer
and are invisible
their symbolism is
very powerful chakras
are universal and
this is what
inspired me to
design this collection
about her collaboration
with noted architect-jewelry designer zaha
hadid arlène says: I have always
admired her work
and have been
deeply interested in
architecture there are
many a similarities
between jewelry and
architecture remarks arlène
primarily it is
the negative shape
of the object
zaha hadid had
a longing to
produce a creation
in gold something she hadn't done before
we spoke and
from that discussion
was born the
skein collection the
skein series was
inspired by cellular
structures in nature
zaha's designs harmoniously
intensify caspita's
aphorism – see the invisible
in a bid
to perfect the
design they commissioned
swiss workshops equipped
with the latest
generation of 3d
printers particularly for
the bracelet it was a
technical feat I
am wildly happy
and honored to
have collaborated with
zaha gushes arlène as
she continues to
craft jewelry for
women who like
to think and
dream arlène drops
a hint about
caspita's forthcoming collection
it is about
transmutation philosophical stones
and hermetic principles…tout un programme
inspired by arabic
elements and henna
designs noor alfardan's fine jewelry
is steeped in
tradition and strongly
influenced by her
middle eastern heritage
noor cut her
teeth as a
buyer in her
family business it sure helped
that her family
the alfardans were
into jewelry and
watch retail business
and represented over
60 brands I wanted to
create something that
would stand out
even to someone
like me who
spends an entire
day surrounded by
jewelry says noor since
her jewelry brand

natalie dormer selena
gomez michelle rodriguez
and nicole scherzinger
have been spotted
wearing its avant-garde collection today
noor's clientele comprise
the well travelled
who have clusters
of basic jewelry
seek new and
arresting designs they buy my
pieces as statement
additions to their
existing collection says the designer
whose work reflects
the fun-loving spirit of
costume jewelry how
did you embark
on this journey? my father used
to take me
to jewelry exhibitions
and his meetings
with jewelers ever
since I was
six after each
meeting I would
draw my favorite
pieces from the
collections we had
just seen I
would alter them
in ways that
i thought would
make the jewelry
look better I
also developed such
a fascination with
gemstones that I
couldn't ever imagine
another path for
myself by the
time I was
13 I was
already designing personal
pieces for friends
family and for
myself but it
wasn't until I
graduated from university
and worked in
the company for
three years that
i decided to
market the pieces
i designed under
my own label
– noudar what was
the first piece
of jewelry you
designed? I designed a
diamond skull necklace
in both yellow
and white gold
when I was
13 I didn't want a
pave setting and
wanted to spread
the diamonds around
the skull in
a random order
i had the
gold in the
middle etched with
lines to make
it look like
a scary skull
as opposed to
a pretty one
i still have
the necklace and
wear it nearly
every day tell
us about your
collaborations with fashion
designer julien macdonald
i collaborated with
julien macdonald on
his presentations during
the london fashion
week for two
years in a
row I absolutely
love his dresses the intricacy of
the beadwork and
embroidery compliment my
jewelry so well
where do you
manufacture your jewelry?
i envisioned creating
a purely qatari
brand that people
would recognize internationally
i wanted everything
including the manufacturing
to be done
in qatar the
jewelry was previously
produced in valencia
italy and the
diamonds sourced directly
from diamond suppliers
in belgium or
bought from suppliers
at exhibitions the
quality was always
lovely I believed we
could achieve the
same outcome in
doha this year
the alfardan group
opened its doors
to our new
hi-tech jewelry workshop
what's new at
noudar? my latest collection
is just being
finished at our
workshop and will
be unveiled at
the doha jewelry
and watch show
in february when
members of a
family such as
the boghossian share
a love of
gemstones rare and
beautiful things are
bound to happen
and thus was
born bogh-art in the
refined world of
high jewelry swiss
high-jeweller bogh-art has carved
a niche for
itself since its
inception in 2007
bogh-art reflects our
desire to bring
something new to
gems: innovative creations that
would stretch the
limits of jewelry
design says albert boghossian
founder and ceo
with the uniqueness
of materials and
considerable time that
goes into putting
each piece together
bogh-art has taken
a huge step
on the path
of elegance and
creativity our vision is
rooted in tradition
but looking to
the future with
new materials and
new techniques that
will do justice
to the beauty
of the gem
we use inspiring
new emotions says
albert the brand's signature style
incorporates neckpieces cuffs
rings encrusted with
the finest diamonds
and rare gemstones
house's sources of
inspiration is the
architecture of the
taj mahal we
enjoy merging cultures
taking elements of
islamic architecture arabic
art persian pottery
or mughal artefacts
to create our
pieces we look
to the east
for motifs and
shapes yet use
these designs in
a european aesthetic
we breathe life
into traditions lost
making the ‘art of inlay'
our signature style
he adds underscoring
the brand's urge to
be fiercely creative
take the newest
in bogh-art's ring collection
which uses the
ancient art of
inlay to bring
together a marquise-cut diamond and
black mother of
pearl hemmed in
with sparkling diamonds
or the sumptuous
colombian emerald and
diamonds parure jewelry
– these jewels all
bear the bogh-art trademark of
originality the skill
and passion for
creativity is reflected
in the ceylan
sapphires diamonds and
keshi salt-water pearls that
add the right
touch of opulence
to the fluid
bracelet and the
toi et moi
earrings that combine
precious stones diamonds
natural pearls in
contrasting colours giving
more character adding
just a hint
of playfulness irgi
389titanium and carbon
fibre jewelry forms
the corolla of
bogh-art's high craft
collection: at the heart
of bogh-art is the
unrelenting determination to
push further the
boundaries of jewelry
design this resolute
approach led the
team to spend
time researching and
developing a new
material that could
be both feminine
and modern the ground-breaking use of
titanium lends the
younger more accessible
pieces an exceptional
lightness and transparency
it also demonstrates
our commitment to
jewelry design and
innovation says albert
the titanium fibre
butterfly earrings in
white gold diamond
and titanium fibre
campanella earrings flower
earrings brooches carbon
bangles and earrings
evoke a touch
of refinement meanwhile
the quest to
discover the most
appealing precious stones
and best ways
to mount them
pose a never
ending challenge for
bogh-art making each
jewel a collector's piece one of my
personal favorites is
a gem pear-shaped flawless emerald
ring of 10
23 carats it
has no indication
of clarity enhancement
which makes it
an exceptional stone
a true treasure
a collector's dream says roberto boghossian
managing director reinforcing
the brand's quiet excellence
and its one-of-a-kind pieces bogh-art has stores
and showrooms in
geneva london hong
kong and brussels

any color darker

not be purchased
