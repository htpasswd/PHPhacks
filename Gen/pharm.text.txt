if you take
prescription drugs to
treat a chronic
illness you could
save money by
splitting your pills
— literally cutting them
in half not
all pills can
be split so
pill splitting cannot
be used in
the treatment of
every chronic disease
but in the
face of mounting
costs for prescription
drugs many doctors
and health authorities
are advising this
strategy with more
and more medicines
most notably all
the cholesterol-lowering drugs known
as statins can
be split as
can many of
the drugs used
to treat high
blood pressure and
depression essentially pill
splitting allows you
to buy two
doses of medicine
for the price
of one — or get two
months worth of
medicine for the
price of one
month there is
no danger in
splitting pills as
long as your
doctor agrees that
its a good
idea for you
you learn how
to do it
properly and you
split only pills
that can be
split simple pill
splitting devices are
now widely available
american pharmacists association
oppose this practice
but these organi- zations acknowledge that
many pills can
be safely split
if done correctly
the department of
veterans affairs allows
pill splitting at
a number of
va facilities though
it does not
formally endorse the
practice most drug
companies oppose pill-split- ting they say
it can be
dangerous but studies
to date have
not shown any
adverse impact on
health in addition
by reducing the
cost of prescription
medicines pill splitting
could improve doctors
have long counseled
patients to split
their pills initially
this was not
to save money
instead it was
to enable people
to take a
dose of medi- cine not readily
available from a
pharmacist thats because
drug companies make
only a few
fixed doses of
any given medication
but many doctors
prefer to tailor
the dose of
a medicine to
a patients exact
needs or to
lower the risk
of side effects
for example a
doctor may want
to prescribe less
of a drug
than the lowest
dose available a
common example of
pill splitting these
days involves good
old aspirin health
authorities now urge
anyone at risk
for heart disease
to take half
an adult aspirin
tablet a day
a regular aspirin
tablet contains 325mg
but studies show
that 160mg or
less is just
as good at
lowering the risk
of a heart
attack or stroke
— and safer some
companies now mak
e half-dose aspirin tablets
and childrens aspirin
comes in lower
doses but often
the least expensive
alternative to buy
a large bottle
of generic aspirin
and split the
pills in half
pill-splitting saves money
because pharmaceutical companies
and pharmacies often charge
nearly the same
amount for a
particular medicine regardless
of its dose
once-a-day drug may
cost $100 for a
months supply of
both a 100mg
dose and a
50mg dose thus
if your doctor
prescribes the 50mg
pill itll cost
you $100 but if
he prescribes the
100mg pill and
instructs you to
cut it in
half $1 00 will
buy you two
medicine if you
tak e several
medicines that kind
of savings can
mount up not
surprisingly many insurance
com- panies are in
favor of pill-splitting because it
saves them money
too your employer
may like the
idea for the
same reason some
insurance compa - nies now provide
you with a
list of approved
drugs to split
and a few
are even requiring
pill-splitting by not
covering the cost
of some lower-dose drugs this
forces people to
buy high- er-dose pills and
split them the
american medical association
and the consult
your doctor about
pill splitting the
dose you take
of most medicines
is very important
if you don't
get the right
dose the effect
of the drug
may be substantially
reduced your doctor
should know which
drugs can be
split and which
cannot you can
consult a pharmacist
too who may
be willing to
show you how
to split your
pills pills are
only safely split
in half and
never into smaller
portions such as
into thirds or
quarters there is
no official complete
list of medicines
split and some
drugs are dangerous
to split that
mak es it
doubly important to
consult a doctor
or pharmacist generally
the following kinds

administration today approved
Cialis to treat
the signs and
symptoms of benign
prostatic hyperplasia a
condition in which
the prostate gland
becomes enlarged and
for the treatment
of bph and
erectile dysfunction when
the conditions occur
simultaneously Cialis was
approved in 2003
of ed common
symptoms of bph
include difficulty in
starting urination and
a weak urine
stream a sudden
urge to urinate
and more frequent
urination including at
night the severity
of symptoms of
bph can be
measured using the
international prostate symptom
score in two
clinical trials men
with bph who
took 5 milligrams
of Cialis once
daily experienced a
statistically significant improvement
in their symptoms
of bph compared
to men who
were treated with
placebo the trials
based their findings
on a reduction
in total ipss
scores in a
third study men
who experienced both
ed and bph
and who took
5 mg of
Cialis once daily
had improvement in
both their symptoms
in their ed
compared to men
who were treated
with placebo the
improvement in ed
was measured using
the erectile function
domain score of
the international index
of erectile function
bph can have
a big impact
on a patients
quality of life
said scott monroe
director of the
division of reproductive
and urologic products
in the fdas
center for drug
evaluation and research
a large number
of older men
have symptoms of
bph Cialis offers
these men another
treatment option particularly
those who also
have ed which
is also common
in older men
Cialis should not
patients taking nitrates
for example nitroglycerin
because the combination
can cause an
unsafe decrease in
blood pressure also
the use of
Cialis in combination
with alpha blockers
of bph is
not recommended because
the combination has
not been adequately
studied for the
treatment of bph
and there is
a risk of
lowering blood pressure
the FDA has
approved eight other
drugs to treat
symptoms of bph: proscar avodart jalyn
and the alpha
blockers: hytrin cardura flomax
uroxatral and rapaflo

food supply cosmetics

that give off

for regulating tobacco
products the makers
of Cialis a
prescription drug to
treat erectile dysfunction
are changing the
way they advertise
it to consumers
a campaign for
Cialis that begins
tomorrow by grey
worldwide in new
york includes changes
like having an
actual doctor appear
on screen during
the television commercials
to recite the
disclaimer warning about
side effects Cialis
is sold by
a partnership of
eli lilly & company and the
icos corporation in
altering its advertising
approach lilly icos
joins Pfizer the
maker of Viagra
the leading brand
among prescription treatments
for erectile dysfunction
in november Viagra
commercials were refocused
more restrained approach
that is centered
not on the
Viagra name but
on urging men
to make the
call and discuss
impotence with their
doctors the shifts
are indicative of
the continuing tug
of war between
supporters and opponents
of prescription drug
ads aimed directly
at consumers such
ads were prohibited
until the food
and drug administration
relaxed its rules
in 1997 the
impotence drugs get
particular attention from
the critics who
object to the
open discussion of
subjects like erections
lasting more than
four hours as
well as some
campaigns that seem
to play up
the salacious aspects
of why men
want the pills
for example the
trade publication advertising
age reported yesterday
that concerns over
campaign content are
leading the national
football league to
discontinue its sponsorship
deal in the
category of impotence
drugs when the
current contract expires
on march 31
that contract with
an estimated value
of $18 million was
signed in 2003
with levitra the
third brand in
the category which
Bayer glaxosmithkline and
schering-plough this is
a heartening trend
and speaks to
a truth we
all know said
creative director of bubble
an agency in
philadelphia that women
and children are
big consumers of
football not just
50- and 60-year-old men current
commercials for levitra
and Viagra avoid
any mention of
the brand names
instead they discuss
erectile dysfunction and
mention the names
of the manufacturers
which frees them
from the requirement
to recite disclaimers
about side effects
including the possibility
of vision impairment
the levitra spots
describe how conditions
like diabetes and
high blood pressure
can affect a
man's love life
and direct viewers
to a web
site which also
does not carry
the levitra name
executives at lilly
icos considered joining
levitra and Viagra
in running what
are called disease-state commercials said
matthew beebe united
states brand team
leader for Cialis
at lilly icos
in Indianapolis but
what patients and
their partners are
telling us is
that they want
to continue to
hear the facts
the benefits about
Cialis mr beebe
said particularly that
its effects can
last up to
36 hours that
difference from levitra
and Viagra which
have effects typically
lasting about four
hours is a
primary reason prescriptions
for Cialis are
continuing to increase
he added compared
with those for
the other drugs
Cialis introduced after
Viagra and levitra
accounts for about
25 percent of
prescriptions compared with
around 14 percent
for levitra and
the rest for
Viagra the category
has not been
growing as much
as drug makers
and wall street
analysts expected considering
it includes several
high-profile brands that
are each spending
tens of millions
of dollars a
year on marketing
the doctor appearing
in the Cialis
commercials jack barkin
is a urologist
and surgeon who
is director of
the male health
center in toronto
mr beebe said
we looked around
for someone with
the skill set
and credibility mr
beebe said adding: he was our
first pick and
the only pick
another change in
Cialis advertising is
to give doctors
more of a
presence on the
brand's web site
also ads for
Cialis are now
running only in
places where 90
percent or more
of the audience
members are adults
up from a
previous minimum of
80 percent Pfizer
made the same
change last fall
for Viagra the
changes mean that
commercials for Cialis
and Viagra will
not appear during
super bowls where
children make up
10 percent to
15 percent of
the audience each
year complaints about
the contents of
spots for erectile
dysfunction drugs increased
after Cialis and
levitra advertised during
super bowl xxxviii
in 2004 Cialis
returned last year
none of the
three are among
the advertisers listed
for super bowl
xl on feb
5 for all
the changes in
the Cialis commercials
many elements remain
from previous ads
including slogans like
when the moment
is right will
you be ready? and the mnemonic
device of showing
a man and
woman keeping company
by soaking in
side-by-side tubs this
is what research
tells us is
right for the
brand said millicent
badillo senior vice
president at grey
worldwide part of
the grey global
group unit of
the wpp group
because although this
affects the man
it also affects
the partner with
people leading busy
stressful lives they
may not always
be in sync
with their partners
she added the
tubs continue to
tell our target:don't worry the
pressure is off
you can relax
it's not like
a parking meter
the concerns about
ads for impotence
drugs may benefit
Cialis because it
has from its
introduction in january
2004 avoided saucy
or ribald sales
pitches we always
said that if
we get too
close to the
act ms badillo
said we're in the
wrong place advertising
has had its
share of nasty
three-way battles over
the years: mcdonald's vs burger
king vs wendy's bud light
vs miller lite
vs coors light
toyota vs nissan
vs honda kellogg's vs post
vs general mills
now comes Viagra
vs levitra vs
Cialis it is
a madison avenue
dream and nightmare
it is a
dream because the
three rivals are
flush with cash
and eager to
compete aggressively in
a market that
is already big
and is forecast
to grow fast
ad agencies have
been panting like
lovesick suitors over
the idea of
clients willing to
spend more than
$300 million this
year when many
other clients are
pinching pennies the
problem is that
the products in
question treat erectile
dysfunction a condition
like adult incontinence
or hemorrhoids that
is hard to
discuss without being
too vague or
too vulgar so
the advertisers have
to figure out
how to build
customer demand and
loyalty without offending
people and without
providing additional fodder
for endless gags
by late-night talk-show hosts even
worse the products
are prescription drugs
so they come
freighted with federal
restrictions and requirements
about advertising content
for instance if
an ad mentions
the product name
and what it
treats side effects
must also be
disclosed in this
case eyebrow-lifters like erections
that last for
more than four
hours my 6-year-old daughter turned
to me and
said what's a four-hour erection
said executive vice president
and chief creative
officer at tierney
communications in philadelphia
who studies sex
issues in marketing
how do you
explain it? the whole endeavor
is mined with
awkward moments beginning
with those faced
by the 30
million american men
who the drug
companies estimate have
trouble getting and
keeping erections only
13 percent of
those men are
being treated drug
makers reckon so
analysts at lehman
brothers figure that
the market for
Viagra levitra and
Cialis should more
than triple by
2010 to $6 billion a
year that is
if the ad
agencies can help
destigmatize seeking treatment
said nancy bryan
vice president for
men's health marketing
at Bayer pharmaceuticals
in west haven
conn it sells
levitra in a
joint venture with
glaxosmithkline in recent
weeks levitra has
slipped to third
place in sales
having been overtaken
by Cialis which
is marketed by
lilly icos a
joint venture of
icos corporation but
together they have
already grabbed 15
percent of the
market from the
leader Viagra which
created the category
when Pfizer introduced
it in 1998
levitra was introduced
last august Cialis
in november as
the rivalry heats
up the ads
are flooding television
radio magazines newspapers
the internet and
even mailboxes the
drug makers are
sponsoring sports like
golf and auto
racing Pfizer has
initiated a frequent-user value card
offering a free
seventh prescription for
each six a
customer fills levitra
and Cialis have
even tried the
super bowl of
advertising: the super bowl
itself their makers
paid more than
$4 million each
for 60-second spots during
the game in
february the ads
are running so
often and in
so many forums
that the drug
companies say they
feel compelled to
change pitches frequently
to keep them
fresh on april
15 Bayer and
glaxosmithkline relinquished the
aggressively macho posture
they had taken
since introducing levitra
the old campaign
was fraught with
symbols: a man failing
then succeeding at
tossing a football
through a tire
swing in its
place levitra released
a commercial created
by the quantum
group in parsippany
n j a
unit of the
wpp group the
ad focused on
a woman's sultry testimonial
to levitra's effect on
her man: let's just say
he notices a
difference in the
experience like awe
should do this
more oftendifference if
that is too
subtle she adds
that levitra gives
her guy the
quality of response
that he wants
time and again
the ads may
be oblique but
the strategy is
not we give
men the quality
erections they want
said david pernock
senior vice president
for pharmaceuticals marketing
at glaxosmithkline in
philadelphia Pfizer aiming
to protect Viagra's market share
has been changing
campaigns continuously for
a couple of
years maybe too
often some contend
i found myself
saying what happened
to Viagra?said cheryl swanson
a principal at
toniq a brand
strategy consultant in
new york the
message has diminished
in february Pfizer
stopped running ads
showing men being
praised by friends
and co-workers for some
obvious but indefinable
difference the unspoken
subtext: they were finally
having intercourse again
now it runs
commercials showing men
leaping for joy
as the exultant
anthem by queen
we are the
champions plays in
the background the
idea: to convey the
confidence that Pfizer
hopes men will
feel after asking
doctors about Viagra
the brand that
captures how people
would like to
see themselves will
succeed said maxine
thomas a creative
planner at the
toronto office of
taxi the Canadian
agency that created
the commercial Pfizer's task is
complicated by its
past success as
the pioneer brand
in an untapped
market Viagra initially
prospered now it
must keep battling
Cialis and levitra
without becoming so
common that it
is perceived as
a generic name
for impotence treatments
as kleenex is
for tissues as
Pfizer executives prepare
for their next
marketing push they
are taking the
unconventional step of
soliciting ideas from
four agencies that
produce ads for
other Pfizer prescription
drugs like lipitor
and zyrtec as
well as from
the agency in
charge of Viagra
ads cline davis
& mann in new
york part of
the omnicom group
the five-way bake-off is likely
to be decided
next month in
time for new
Viagra ads to
come out in
the third quarter
the environment is
changing and we
want to make
sure we remain
relevant said dorothy
wetzel vice president
for consumer marketing
at the united
states pharmaceuticals division
of Pfizer in
new york just
as the Pfizer
research and development
division screens thousands
of different compounds
to find the
one that makes
a difference she
said we're trying to
apply the same
process to our
communication development:
getting multiple agencies
to develop ideas
and screen it
down to onekillercommunication
continue reading the
main story it's almost enough
to drive marketers
to another Pfizer
drug xanax understanding
consumers is an
ongoing journey ms
wetzel said one
that keeps her
and the rest
of Pfizer up
at night as
is typical in
consumer-brand battles Viagra's competitors are
trying to outflank
the market leader
with contrasting portrayals
of their productsattributes
glaxosmithkline wants to
portray levitra as
the product that
really works mr
pernock said and
to reassure men
with erectile dysfunction
that they are
no less manly
it began with
what ms swanson
the brand strategist
at toniq called
a stereotypical gridiron
persona typified by
the spokesman mike
ditka former coach
of the chicago
bears in your
face pointing his
finger at you
it also has
vital brand colors
purple and orange
and of course
that tire swing
all of which
combine to make
a guy feel
more comfortable offer
reassurance she said
now levitra has
shifted to including
the woman's point of
view and a
new slogan quality
when it counts
from the start
Cialis came from
a different direction: warmer and gentler
almost more feminine
that was apparent
in its name
pronounced see-alice its color
scheme pastel green
and yellow and
its soft-focus campaign showing
a woman side
by side often
relaxing in matching
bathtubs the different
less-hurried approach stems
from a fundamental
difference between Cialis
and its rivals: while Viagra and
levitra provide a
four-hour window during
which a man
can get and
keep an erection
Cialis opens that
window to 36
hours the continuous
presence of women
in Cialis ads
is a subtle
signal that the
drug makes it
easier for them
to set the
pace with their
men in contrast
to the primarily
male-driven imagery for
for this reason
Europeans have dubbed
Cialis le weekend
drug in research
sessions conducted before
lilly icos began
selling Cialis women
whose partners used
Viagra or levitra
complained thatit feels
like there's three of
us in bed
the man the
woman and the
pill said matt
beebe united states
brand team leader
in Indianapolis for
Cialis after hearing
of the potential
36-hour duration of
Cialis men and
women described the
concept of wanting
to choose the
moment he added
which helped us
shape our advertising
Cialis's slogan is
will you be
ready? the grey worldwide
agency in new
group spent three
years developing the
Cialis campaign the
basic insight was
that it takes
two to tango
but no one
was paying attention
to the relationship
said millicent badillo
the senior vice
president for account
services at grey
who oversees the
account Cialis is
restoring what you
were doing before
you had erectile
dysfunction and that's a heck
of a place
to be such
enthusiasm led to
some creative discussions
that had to
be reined in
one ad for
example shows a
woman rubbing the
bald head of
a man washing
his car we
could have taken
it to the
hose moment ms
badillo said but
that's not where
we wanted to
go for the
most part grey
and lilly icos
have relied on
the bathtub image
now as symbolic
for Cialis as
the tire swing
the blue diamond-shaped pill for
Viagra it's associated with
all the good
things patients want
ms badillo said
intimate moments taking
your time being
stress-free it isn't a quickie
shower she added
there is no
rush here that
low-key approach trying
as toniq's ms swanson
put it to
keep to a
certain level of
taste could help
Cialis pass muster
from critics of
the more explicit
ads in the
category even if
the Cialis campaign
must include that
disclaimer about the
four-hour side effect
taste is why
grey chose his-and-hers bathtubs rather
than a shared
hot tub we
don't want to
put Cialis that
sex act mr
beebe said you
won't see a
lot of sexual
innuendo: a train going
through a tunnel
a football going
through a beat-up tire that
jest clearly aimed
at levitra points
up another way
the brandsfight mimics
more traditional consumer-product
skirmishes: rivals take potshots
at one another
commercial run by
levitra for the
super bowl featured
mr ditka suggesting
that football is
superior to baseball
a sport that
Viagra has sponsored
it would be
lovely to see
them use more
humor said ms
simmons of tierney
communications she said
she was bothered
by how many
of the ads
so far have
concentrated on the
man figuring out
how to getitdone
humor not only
lightens the mood
she added but
also acknowledges that
men and women
have been talking
to each other
about sex in
veiled terms for
centuries one idea
she offered gratis
to the drug
makers: hire the comedian
george carlin to
discuss erectile dysfunction
in the context
of his routine
about the seven
words you can't say on
television he'd be hysterical
ms simmons said
and he's the right
age Cialis relaxes
muscles found in
the walls of
blood vessels and
increases blood flow
to particular areas
of the body
Cialis is used
to treat erectile
dysfunction and symptoms
of benign prostatic
hypertrophy another brand
of Tadalafil is
adcirca which is
used to treat
pulmonary arterial hypertension
do not take
Cialis while also
taking adcirca unless
your doctor tells
you to important
information some medicines
can cause unwanted
or dangerous effects
when used with
Cialis tell your
doctor about all
your current medicines
especially riociguat do
not take Cialis
if you are
also using a
nitrate drug for
chest pain or
heart problems including
nitroglycerin isosorbide dinitrate
isosorbide mononitrate and
some recreational drugs
such as poppers
taking Cialis with
a nitrate medicine
can cause a
sudden and serious
decrease in blood
pressure contact your
doctor or seek
emergency medical attention
if your erection
is painful or
lasts longer than
4 hours a
prolonged erection can
damage the penis
stop using Cialis
and get emergency
medical help if
you have sudden
vision loss before
taking this medicine
you should not
take Cialis if
you are allergic
to Tadalafil or: if you take
other medicines to
treat pulmonary arterial
hypertension such as
riociguat do not
you are also
using a nitrate
drug for chest
pain or heart
problems this includes
and isosorbide mononitrate
nitrates are also
found in some
recreational drugs such
as amyl nitrate
or nitrite taking
Cialis with a
nitrate medicine can
cause a sudden
and serious decrease
in blood pressure
to make sure
Cialis is safe
for you tell
your doctor if

or kidney disease
a blood cell
disorder such as
sickle cell anemia
multiple myeloma or
leukemia a bleeding
hemophilia a stomach
ulcer retinitis pigmentosa
a physical deformity
of the penis
or if you
have been told
have sexual intercourse
for health reasons
Cialis can decrease
blood flow to
the optic nerve
of the eye
causing sudden vision
loss this has
occurred in a
small number of
people taking Viagra
or other drugs
similar to Tadalafil
most of these
people also had
certain pre-existing eye problems
or risk factors
for blood vessel
disorders it is
not clear whether
Cialis is the
actual cause of
vision loss Tadalafil
is not expected
to harm an
unborn baby tell
you are pregnant
or plan to
become pregnant it
is not known
whether Tadalafil passes
into breast milk
or if it
could harm a
nursing baby tell
you are breast-feeding a baby

work the man
needs to be
sexually aroused - it does not
provide an instant
erection without sexual
stimulation how does
an erection occur? what does Cialis
do? penile erection occurs
when the penis
fills with blood
this happens because
the blood vessels
that bring blood
flow to the
penis dilate thus
increasing the blood
supply simultaneously the
blood vessels that
remove blood from
the penis contract
so that blood
accumulates when a
man is sexually
stimulated nitric oxide
is released into
the penis nitric
oxide makes guanylate
cyclase produce cgmp
cgmp controls the
dilation and contraction
of the blood
vessels that carry
blood to and
from the penis
- when those supplying
the penis with
blood are dilated
and the others
that remove blood
are contracted an
erection occurs another
enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 destroys cgmp
when this occurs
return to their
normal size and
the erection ends
Tadalafil stops phosphodiesterase-5
from destroying
cgmp i e
it prolongs the
duration of cgmp
which results in
a prolonged and
better erection important

shortly before mens
health day on
oct 28 reports
of a new
study of sex
in china presented
in jokey and
sympathetic language raced
through the internet
the topic was
guaranteed to attract
as much attention
in china as
anywhere else: a sexual revolution
has been underway
in the country
since at least
the early 1990s
with the easing
of severe maoist-era repression chinese
men overworked and
overstressed were suffering
high levels of
impotence said the
study china ideal
sex blue book
only a little
over half of
the thousands interviewed
were achieving full
erections which it
described as being
like a cucumber
for dr jiang
hui a urologist
at the peking
university third hospital
and an author
of the study
which was conducted
by the china
sexology association and
two chinese health
publications and supported
by Pfizer the
manufacturer of the
erectile dysfunction drug
Viagra it was
more evidence that
chinese men need
help — preferably from prescription
drugs like Viagra
or Cialis in
a telephone interview
dr jiang declined
to say exactly
how Pfizer supported
the survey or
why the report
recommended the companys
products as a
first line of
treatment in scientific
terms the survey
was of very
limited significance for
methodological reasons everett
yuehong zhang a
professor of east
asia studies at
princeton university said
in an email
but it was
significant in another
way it can
be referenced to
as a sign
of the sustaining
research interest in
this topic said
mr zhang whose
book the impotence
epidemic: mens medicine and
sexual desire in
contemporary china is
to be published
next year to
mr zhang the
epidemic is mostly
about the increased
visibility of the
problem as chinese
men become more
willing to seek
treatment reflecting the
changing nature of
desire in china
today for men
and women in
that sense he
said departing from
the crisis tone
of the china
ideal sex blue
book what is
being termed an
impotence epidemic could
actually be a
positive thing through
anthropological fieldwork i
conducted in mens
clinics i discovered
that we are
not sure that
more chinese men
are suffering from
impotence than before
he said instead
we are sure
that more impotent
men are encouraged
to break silence
and reach out
to doctors in
order to cure
impotence he said
this tendency reflects
the overall orientation
today of the
chinese population — men as well
as women — to satisfy sexual
desire mr zhang
who interviewed about
350 couples for
his book found
plenty of evidence
of psychological factors
as well as
physiological ones some
may have distinctly
chinese characteristics in
so many men
and women i
interviewed the ups
and downs of
male potency may
be related to
the ups and
downs of ones
social status he
said trauma was
an issue from
famine or political
violence as was
losing a safe
state job under
the economic reforms
or having to
drink excessively or
visit prostitutes with
colleagues or officials
to secure business
deals ultimately this
was about chinas
search for modernity
mr zhang said
in chinese history
yu — sexual desire — tended to have
pejorative connotations mr
zhang said sex
was often expressed
by terms like
se and yin
words that persist
throughout the chinese-speaking world including
in hong kong
and taiwan sexual
pleasure had been
a function of
sexual practices before
but satisfaction of
sexual desire had
never been so
publicly justified and
encouraged until the
post-mao era particularly
since the 1990s
he said also
satisfying sexual desire
in particular and
satisfying individualized desire
in general had
central to chinese
peoples own sense
of being a
modern person for
dr jiang chinese
men are still
too reluctant to
seek help he
hoped his survey
would help educate
people about sexual
problems people just
don't have the
knowledge he said
men with erectile
dysfunction may be
able to avoid
the awkwardness of
a doctors visit
by buying the
drug Cialis without
a prescription under
a proposal announced
wednesday by the
drugs maker eli
lilly and the
french pharmaceutical company
sanofi under the
plan sanofi is
buying the rights
to seek approval
to sell Cialis
over the counter
states europe canada
and australia after
certain patents expire
Cialis is to
lose its patent
protection in the
united states and
europe in 2017
after which sales
are expected to
drop sharply as
cheaper generic alternatives
arrive on the
market if approved
for over-the-counter use Cialis
could gain an
advantage over prescription
competitors like Viagra
sold by Pfizer
but it is
the food and
drug administration or
other regulatory bodies
overseas would approve
such a move: in 2008 Pfizer
abandoned an effort
to make Viagra
available without a
prescription after the
European medicines agency
raised concerns “millions of men
worldwide trust Cialis
to treat e
d or erectile
dysfunction said david
a ricks president
of lilly bio-medicines the unit
of lilly that
oversees Cialis we
are pleased to
work with sanofi
to pursue a
path that could
allow more men
who suffer from
e d to
obtain convenient access
to a safe
and reliable product
without a prescription
although more than
45 million men
have taken Cialis
according to lilly
the drug is
not without risks: like similar treatments
it should not
be taken with
some heart medications
because it could
cause an unsafe
pressure a spokeswoman
for the f
d a said
the agency would
need to review
what types of
studies would be
needed for an
like Cialis to
be sold without
a prescription drug
companies frequently seek
approval to move
popular drugs to
over-the-counter sales in
an effort to
hang onto sales
when a best-selling product loses
its patent protection
in 2003 astrazeneca
got approval to
sell its blockbuster
heartburn drug Prilosec
and in 2012
it sold over-the-counter rights to
a similar drug
nexium to Pfizer
the nonprescription product
nexium 24hr went
on sale this
week sales of
erectile dysfunction drugs
have soared since
Viagra was approved
in 1998 but
the companies that
sell them have
also struggled against
the social stigma
of male impotence
many men unwilling
to visit a
doctor for a
prescription — or seeking lower
prices — have turned to
online marketplaces many
of which sell
the drugs illegally
last year in
recoup some of
those lost sales
Pfizer began selling
Viagra to consumers
through its own
website the move
to make Cialis
prescription could be
seen in a
similar vein as
removing one of
the hurdles — a visit to
the doctor — to getting treatment
but one urologist
dr kevin l
billups of the
johns hopkins school
of medicine expressed
concern about moving
Cialis to an
over-the-counter product because
he said erectile
dysfunction can be
an early warning
sign for more
serious conditions like
diabetes and heart
disease maybe youre
missing an opportunity
to pick up
something else said
dr billups who
the schools mens
health and vitality
program Cialis which
was approved in
the united states
in 2003 brought
in $2 2 billion
in worldwide sales
last year Viagra
which recently lost
in several countries
brought in $1 9 billion
for our most
recent ask the
expert feature we
invited readers to
send us questions
about female sexuality
and aging there
was such a
strong response that
our expert susan
kellogg a professor
of obstetrics and
gynecology will be
answering a second
round of questions
on wednesday these
questions — mainly from women
— touched me for
their honesty sincerity
and directness they
were mostly about
their struggles with
menopause pain during
intercourse and their
disappointments and their
disappointed husbands boomers
are supposed to
be the greatest
generation in the
battle against aging
and yet among
our questioners things
didn't sound great
i am 60
and have not
had any interest
or sexual activity
in years when
i try to
masturbate i cant
get anything going
this makes me
sad as i
wasnt prepared to
lose this part
of my being
in my 50s
i had a
healthy sex drive
before i eat
well exercise etc
are there any
routes out of
this place? i am in
a stable marriage
with children and
i love my
husband but i
have absolutely no
sex drive months
will go by
without sex and
i am o
k with it
somewhat my husband
less so is
there anything that
can help? is there a
magic pill? several questioners mentioned
painful dryness when
they attempted intercourse
if you believe
what you see
nightly on tv
such people are
unfortunate exceptions youve
seen the commercials
while washing the
dishes the handsomely
aging husband accidentally
brushes against his
beautifully aging wife
she looks at
him knowingly he
looks at her
tentatively he pops
a Cialis now
they are both
looking at each
other knowingly lovingly
and longingly — and while we
viewers are moving
on to the
next commercial theyre
in bed doing
wild things which
is the true
vision of boomer
love? probably a lot
closer to the
readers questions and
definitely nothing like
a Cialis commercial
thats the impression
you get from
reading the 2010
national survey of
sexual health and
behavior conducted by
researchers at Indiana
university who interviewed
5 865 men
and women — the biggest study
of its kind
conducted in this
country biology trumps
will while the
publication of the
survey in the
journal of sexual
medicine was widely
reported at the
time few in
the mainstream news
media did detailed
reporting on it
when i showed
debra herbenick one
of the studys
lead researchers the
questions women had
sent us she
was not surprised
and pointed me
to statistics that
reflect the marked
decrease in sexual
activity as we
age half of
women 50 to
59 have not
had sex in
the last year
according to the
survey that compares
with 30 percent
of those 40
to 49 before
menopause in most
women in the
case of men
42 percent of
those 50 to
59 report they
have not had
sex in the
last year versus
those 30 to
39 seventy-one percent of
men 30 to
39 said theyd
the last month
versus 61 percent
to 49 and
44 percent of
59 with women
64 percent of
39 reported having
previous month versus
56 percent of
those 40 to
49 40 percent
of those 50
to 59 and
29 percent of
those 60 to
69 sex drugs
rock n roll
and more sex? about 10 percent
of men and
59 said they
had sex two
to three times
a week about
a third the
rate for those
25 to 29
health plays a
significant role too
and the more
we age the
more ills we
have among women
50 to 59
years old 51
percent of those
in good to
excellent health said
theyd had sex
at least once
in the previous
90 days compared
with 25 percent
for those describing
their health as
fair to poor
from 60 to
69 only 8
percent of women
who said their
health was fair
to poor reported
having had sex
90 days several
of the women
who sent us
questions had battled
cancer and were
distressed that they
were unable to
get their sex
lives back there
is some positive
news aging men
and women are
not giving up
and theres more
openness to discussing
these things than
in earlier generations
said dr herbenick
a 71-year-old woman wrote
dr kellogg asking
if she could
recommend any positions
to improve her
sexual pleasure as
i read through
dr kelloggs answers
what struck me
was that there
is no magic
pill — whatever the brand
— and that holding
onto an active
sex life is
as much art
as science she
recommended nonhormonal and
hormonal creams various
types of lubricants
staying in shape
eating healthy foods
reducing stress even
reading erotic literature
my favorite answer
involved adjusting lifes
priorities dr kellogg
wrote: it can be
really hard to
juggle the demands
of marriage motherhood
working etc often
it is as
if sex gets
relegated to the
bottom of the
to do list
— and it gets
done only once
a month there
pill for libido
absence of a
pain problem or
serious disease the
best advice i
can give on
this topic is
to reprioritize sex
in your relationship
realize that sexual
drive in long-term relationships isnt
something that just
happens — it takes work
couples who do
not share any
sort of regular
intimacy become best
friends and roommates
but over time
i find they
may lack the
connection that helps
to sustain couples
through many of
lifes challenges many
women i see
in my clinic
are really good
at maintaining very
complex lifestyles but
they tell me
that they have
no time for
sex with their
partner these same
women never miss
a childs soccer
game a monthly
planning meeting for
work a yoga
class with a
friend — whether they are
tired or not
they mark these
activities on their
calendars and smartphones
and prioritize them
sexually connecting with
a partner whether
its through intercourse
or some other
intimate behavior really
takes a similar
type of commitment
to that i
would add having
realistic expectations when
that Cialis ad
comes on turn
off the tv
and take a
walk with your
spouse new guidelines
from the american
college of physicians
strongly endorse the
use of medications
like Cialis levitra
and Viagra for
erectile dysfunction so
long as patients
have no risk
factors for the
drugs the medications
known as pde5
inhibitors are highly
effective and generally
cause only mild
side effects according
to a review
of evidence from
130 randomized controlled
trials the drugs
cannot be used
by patients who
take nitrate medications
or have unstable
heart disease otherwise
though the side
effects are generally
limited to diarrhea
headaches and nausea
visual disturbances which
are seldom severe
and rare cases
of painful long-lasting erections said
dr amir qaseem
senior medical associate
at the american
and the senior
author of the
new guidelines being
published early this
week in the
online issue of
annals of internal
medicine dr qaseem
said erectile dysfunction
affected all age
groups including younger
men with diabetes
and depression as
well as older
men who have
chronic conditions he
added that men
who experienced the
problem for three
months or more
should talk to
their doctors patients
need to know
that erectile dysfunction
is a common
disorder dr qaseem
said adding physicians
need to be
made aware of
it too the

mean? ive been baffled

looking for an
answer until my
wife started asking
the same question
weve puzzled over
it together the
two bathtubs have
long been the
symbol for Cialis
a drug to
that competes against
Viagra i would
imagine dear reader
that the people
at eli lilly
who have spent
billions of dollars
to market Cialis
will be profoundly
depressed that you
confused the two
brands in any
event the bathtubs
have been featured
in Cialis advertising
since the product
came out the
tubs are symbols
of relaxing taking
your time not
hurrying in that
a bath is
more relaxing than
a shower they
reflected that from
the start Cialis
advertising was warmer
and gentler than
ads for Viagra
more feminine as
it were other
cues included a
color scheme of
yellow and pastel

generic Viagra from
mail-order pharmacies legit? Viagra is an
expensive drug that
rightly or wrongly
Medicare and many
private drug plans
won't cover lately
i'm getting emails
and calls from
what purports to
be a Canadian
pharmacy trying to
sell me generic
Viagra at a
substantial discount what
is the truth
about generic Viagra? in short no
a cheaper generic
version of Viagra
— the blue pill
that is made
by the drug
company Pfizer — isnt sold yet
states though by
late 2017 one
is expected to
be available any
pharmacy thats offering
generic Viagra is
probably using counterfeit
product thats not
approved said carmen
catizone the executive
national association of
boards of pharmacy
a professional organization
unaffiliated with drug
makers on costco
com each 100-milligram tablet of
prescription Viagra costs
roughly $50 though this
is the cash
price and does
not include insurance
discounts by contrast
various sites claim
to sell generic
Viagra from overseas
for $1 to $4 a pop
while a generic
form of Viagra
known as Sildenafil
is made in
some countries bargain
hunters may be
buying sugar pills
or inadvertently getting
a low dose
the medication may
be there but
its a much
lower dose then
the guy gets
depressed because he
thinks nothing is
going to work
said dr darius
paduch the director
of sexual health
and medicine at
weill cornell medicine
and newyork-presbyterian so he
may stop having
sex or never
see a doctor
medical problems can
also arise if
a patient gets
fake Viagra thats
substantially less effective
but doesnt disclose
that he got
it from a
suspect site touting
cheap Viagra dr
paduch said i
will escalate their
treatment thinking they
took the prescription
he might for
example suggest penile
injection therapy which
can have serious
side effects for
a man who
has mild erectile
dysfunction as the
injections are for
more severe cases
all the while
the patient with
a mild case
might have responded
to bona fide
Viagra from a
legitimate pharmacy shame
is the issue
not cost for
some people even
with a prescription
dr paduch said
some patients prefer
to buy online
or trek to
the office for
a free sample
rather than face
the pharmacist they
are so ashamed
because of the
stigma which is
completely stupid said
dr paduch who
used to be
a paid research
investigator for eli
lilly the maker
of Cialis another
pill for erectile
dysfunction roger bate
a pharmaceutical expert
enterprise institute warned
men not to
answer a random
spam email selling
really cheap Viagra
youre running a
significant risk he
said with some
websites not only
trying to get
your money and
sell you a
fake pill but
probably trying to
steal your identity
as well but
he said real
Viagra made by
Pfizer is available
from some foreign
websites he recommends
looking for sites
certified by the
Canadian international pharmacy
association a trade
group of Canadian
pharmacies or those
vetted by pharmacychecker
com a company
that verifies international
online pharmacies on
its site the
also lists vetted
pharmacies where patients
can get safe
and effective medication
at competitive prices
mr catizone said
insurance often covers
six to eight
erectile dysfunction pills
a month and
both Pfizer and
eli lilly offer
discount programs the
first prescription drug
to enhance womens
sexual drive won
regulatory approval on
tuesday clinching a
victory for a
lobbying campaign that
had accused the
administration of gender
bias for ignoring
the sexual needs
of women the
drug — addyi from sprout
pharmaceuticals — is actually the
first drug approved
to treat a
flagging or absent
libido for either
sex Viagra and
other drugs available
for men are
approved to help
achieve erections or
to treat certain
deficiencies of the
hormone testosterone not
to increase desire
advocates who pressed
for approval of
addyi many of
them part of
a coalition called
even the score
said that a
drug to improve
womens sex lives
was long overdue
given the many
options available to
men this is
the biggest breakthrough
for womens sexual
health since the
pill said sally
greenberg executive director
of the national
consumers league but
critics said the
campaign behind addyi
had made a
mockery of the
system that regulates
pharmaceuticals and had
co-opted the womens
movement to pressure
a into approving
a drug that
was at best
minimally effective and
could cause side
effects like low
blood pressure fainting
nausea dizziness and
sleepiness in announcing
the approval dr
janet woodcock a
a official said
the agency was
committed to supporting
the development of
safe and effective
treatments for female
sexual dysfunction the
f d a
decision on tuesday
was not a
surprise since an
advisory committee of
outside experts had
recommended by a
vote of 18
to 6 in
june that the
drug be approved
albeit with precautions
required to try
to limit the
risks and ensure
that it was
not overused continue
reading the main
story addyis label
has a boxed
warning — the strongest kind
— saying the drug
used by those
who drink alcohol
since that can
increase the risk
of severely low
fainting it is
also not to
be used with
certain other drugs
and by people
with liver impairment
the pill can
be prescribed or
dispensed only by
doctors and pharmacists
who watch an
online slide presentation
and pass a
test of their
comprehension women are
advised to stop
using the drug
if they see
no effect after
eight weeks the
big question now
is how many
people will use
addyi which is
also known as
Flibanserin and has
been called the
pink Viagra according
to one survey
about 10 percent
of women suffer
from hypoactive sexual
desire disorder the
said the drug
was approved for
women whose loss
of sexual desire
causes marked distress
or interpersonal difficulty
and is not
the result of
illness relationship problems
or side effects
of other medicines
dr lauren streicher
associate professor of
clinical obstetrics and
gynecology at northwestern
university said she
sensed great interest
for a drug
like addyi among
her patients she
said the drugs
availability would encourage
many women to
talk to doctors
about their sexual
problems for the
first time i
think this is
going to change
the conversation thats
taking place in
medical offices across
the country she
said much as
the 1998 approval
of Viagra made
it acceptable for
men to talk
about erectile dysfunction
leonore tiefer a
sex therapist at
the new york
university school of
medicine and critic
predicted the restrictions
on use would
keep addyi from
becoming popular its
going to be
more trouble than
its worth she
said cindy whitehead
the chief executive
of sprout declined
to predict sales
of addyi which
she said would
be available starting
oct 17 to
allay concerns that
the drug would
be overused sprout
has said it
would not advertise
on radio or
television for 18
months after the
drugs approval ms
whitehead said the
company would focus
its marketing on
doctors not consumers
she said sprout
planned to hire
200 sales representatives
enough to call
on about 30
000 doctors mainly
obstetricians and gynecologists
but also some
psychiatrists and primary
care physicians she
said the exact
price of addyi
had not been
decided but suggested
roughly equivalent on
a monthly basis
to erectile dysfunction
pills those pills
are generally taken
when needed while
addyi is supposed
to be taken
every night before
bedtime that makes
a direct comparison
difficult but 10
Viagra tablets a
possible monthly allotment
cost about $400 it is
not clear if
insurance companies will
pay for addyi
ms whitehead said
that she expected
many would with
a co-payment of about
$30 to $75 a month
sprout will assist
patients with co-payments she said
some doctors might
use the drug
beyond the uses
in the label
which doctors are
allowed to do
dr streicher said
that although the
drug was approved
for premenopausal women
only she absolutely
would prescribe it
for postmenopausal women
as well dr
irwin goldstein a
sex-medicine doctor in
san diego who
has been a
consultant to sprout
said he would
not necessarily withhold
the drug from
casual drinkers some
women might find
the risk of
side effects acceptable
if their relationships
are in jeopardy
because of a
lack of desire
he said thats
a risk too
dr goldstein said
he would also
not rule out
prescribing the drug
off-label to men
there was interest
in learning whether
work for men
but sprouts priorities
would be to
get it approved
next for postmenopausal
women and in
foreign markets addyi
is thought to
work by changing
the balance of
certain brain neurotransmitters
like dopamine and
serotonin there are
disagreements among researchers
as to what
constitutes normal sexual
desire in women
and there have
been difficulties bringing
to market a
drug that would
treat low desire
procter & gamble failed to
win approval for
a testosterone skin
patch for women
about a decade
ago the f
d a rejected
addyi twice in
2010 and 2013
citing marginal effectiveness
and the side
effects in one
trial for instance
women who took
the drug had
an average of
4 4 satisfying
sexual experiences a
month compared with
3 7 for
women getting a
placebo and 2
7 before the
study began the
drug did not
increase desire more
than a placebo
when measured by
a daily diary
but did do
so modestly when
measured by a
monthly questionnaire after
the first rejection
boehringer ingelheim abandoned
the drug ms
whitehead and her
husband robert were
at the time
running a company
that sold a
testosterone product for
men the whiteheads
sold that business
and formed sprout
to acquire Flibanserin
based in raleigh
n c sprout
a privately held
company had raised
about $100 million ms
whitehead said after
the second rejection
various womens and
health groups formed
sprout is paying
at least part
of the expenses
for the coalition
whose members include
the national council
of womens organizations
the black womens
health imperative and
the association of
reproductive health professionals
even after the
favorable advisory committee
vote critics of
the drug sent
letters to the
urging it to
reject addyi the
agency usually follows
the advice of
its committees but
does not have
to one letter
written by dr
signed by about
100 others said
it was absurd
to expect that
young women taking
addyi would refrain
from drinking alcohol
another by the
pharmedout project at
georgetown university medical
center which also
had more than
100 signatures said
that the unprecedented
and unwarranted manufacturer
funded public relations
campaign may have
confused the advisory
committee members a
third letter from
sex researchers in
the netherlands and
belgium said the
drug was based
on the mistaken
notion that lack
of spontaneous sexual
desire absent stimuli
was abnormal even
the score is
planning to stay
in business hoping
that the approval
of addyi will
spur other companies
to develop drugs
health its never
been about one
treatment said ms
greenberg of the
national consumers league
which received a
contribution from sprout
and which formally
joined even the
score this month

trouble achieving an
erection don't want
the whole world
to know so
i agreed to
identify the 77-year-old from white
plains only as
mr j he
and his wife
married in 1959
he told me
and when his
problems began years
ago he didn't
want to relinquish
sexual intimacy its
a part of
life he said
sex never dies
on the advice
of his urologist
he uses a
vacuum erection device
less formally known
as a penis
pump its cheaper
over time than
and mr j
believes its safer
too he discreetly
leaves the bedroom
to use it
— it can be
embarrassing at times
— but the pump
performs drawing blood
into the penis
to enable intercourse
its a little
awkward and inconvenient
and its not
very romantic dr
ira d sharlip
a urologist at
the university of
california san francisco
said of the
pump but it
can be effective
on july 1
however Medicare stopped
covering vacuum erection
devices the result
of legislation congress
passed in december
since 2006 congress
has banned Medicare
part d coverage
of medications for
erectile dysfunction too
after representative steve
king republican of
iowa scoffed at
lifestyle drugs and
said taxpayers wouldnt
foot the tab
for grandpas Viagra
that leaves millions
of men with
no Medicare option
for what we
used to call
impotence except far
more expensive and
invasive penile implant
surgery erectile dysfunction
problem about 60
percent of men
older than 60
— and 70 percent
of those in
their 70s — have trouble getting
or maintaining erections
often because of
diabetes cardiovascular disease
or prostate cancer
treatment said dr
eugene rhee past
president of the
california urological association
not all of
them want treatment
of course a
large proportion of
older men have
lost sexual interest
don't have a
partner or have
other illnesses that
preclude sexual activity
dr sharlip said
main story moreover
some men who
opt for treatment
can afford to
pay out of
pocket for levitra
Cialis or Viagra
— the last has
a wholesale price
of $38 per pill
according to Pfizer
— or for vacuum
erection systems that
retail for $125 to $500 but it
is fair to
say that many
thousands of modest-income
Medicare beneficiaries
will now forgo
treatment for erectile
dysfunction and fair
to ask if
this policy makes
sense i think
it reflects an
antiquated concept about
the importance of
sexuality in a
persons life dr
sharlip said many
remain sexually active
in later decades
given the opportunity
the national survey
and behavior for
instance showed that
almost 40 percent
of men in
their 60s and
more than 28
older than 70
had engaged in
vaginal intercourse within
the previous month
with smaller and
larger percentages reporting
other sexual behaviors
among older women
nearly half of
those in their
60s and more
than 20 percent
their 70s had
been sexually active
six months university
of pittsburgh medical
center researchers reported
recently the biggest
obstacle was the
lack of a
partner among those
married or cohabiting
the proportion reporting
sexual activity rose
substantially to 68
percent and 41
percent prevalence of
sexual activity definitely
goes down with
age said dr
holly n thomas
an internist and
the lead author
but the proportion
is still considerable
and certainly higher
than many physicians
and the public
would guess to
answer the obvious
question Medicare covers
womens hormonal creams
rings and suppositories
for a medically
accepted indication like
vaginal atrophy some
part d formularies
require high co-pay charges for
those drugs however
there are multiple
multiple studies showing
a strong link
between good sex
and quality of
life in both
younger and older
individuals dr thomas
said but when
it comes to
financing this particular
facet of health
care older adults
are pretty much
on their own
in debates over
these policies its
not hard to
discern an undercurrent
of ageism the
last time i
wrote about Medicare
and sexual dysfunction
one reader called
the pump then
a covered expense
just another old
white guy perk
… grandpa wants an
erection! another said go
away old coots
but most commenters
insisted they werent
against older adults
having sex they
just didn't see
why a government
program should underwrite
it Medicare does
have to control
costs and on
that score the
program has given
critics plenty of
ammunition sadly a
report by the
health and human
services inspector general
last year found
that Medicare was
paying grossly excessive
prices for the
vacuum pumps an
average of $451 more than
twice the amount
paid by the
department of veterans
affairs from 2006
through 2011 the
investigators said Medicare
paid for nearly
half a million
pumps if it
had spent what
others did for
the same devices
taxpayers would have
saved more than
$14 million a
year and Medicare
beneficiaries would have
saved $4 million late-night talk show
hosts had a
field day rather
than addressing the
overrun by adding
the devices to
Medicares competitive bidding
program for medical
equipment though congress
just cut off
funding the reason?
representative ander crenshaw
republican of florida
needed to finance
the laudable-sounding able act
which allows disabled
people to set
up tax-free savings accounts
for housing education
and transportation he
found nine items
to cut from
Medicare and other
parts of the
federal budget including
the pumps under
the act which
drew bipartisan support
vacuum erection devices
wont be covered
by Medicare until
congress authorizes coverage
drugs taking benefits
from one vulnerable
population to bankroll
benefits for another
has not exactly
set off a
furor a statement
from mr crenshaw
said my office
received no outside
objection to the
provision from constituents
groups or organizations
as the bill
moved to passage
and was signed
into law and
has received none
since perhaps politicians
arent eager to
defend penis pumps
still the question
of what Medicare
covers has become
anything but straightforward
one might argue
that maintaining patients
ability to have
sex should be
a low priority
given the other
demands on the
program yet most
of us probably
consider hearing and
eating high priorities
and Medicare doesnt
pay for hearing
aids or dental
care either one
might contend as
mr king did
that Medicare should
restrict itself to
lifesaving drugs but
the program covers
a variety of
procedures medications and
devices for conditions
that affect quality
of life but
arent life-threatening Medicare covers
migraine drugs for
example and breast
reconstruction surgery after
a mastectomy we
fix knees and
hips and theyre
not killers said
dr ken smith
a professor of
medicine at the
university of pittsburgh
of a 2000
analysis that found
Viagra to be
a cost-effective treatment compared
with other medical
interventions it was
actually a fairly
reasonable use of
health care dollars
he said the
v a and
private insurers apparently
agree and still
cover erectile dysfunction
drugs and pumps
sexual health is
widely considered part
of overall health
— unless you are
an older man
or his partner
in which case
its often considered
a joke not
by mr j
though to me
sex is a
pleasure he said
its not everything
but its important
a chinese pharmaceutical
company has received
the green light
from chinas state
administration to become
the countrys first
official producer of
a homegrown version
of Viagra Pfizers
famous erectile dysfunction
drug Pfizers patent
on Viagra expired
in china in
may following patent
expirations in several
European countries and
elsewhere that are
expected to undercut
profits for the
american pharmaceutical giant
as cheaper alternatives
are rolled out
since may chinese
companies have been
vying with one
another to emerge
as the dominant
player in the
new market for
generic versions of
the pill in
the early stages
of the competition
guangzhou baiyunshan pharmaceutical
appears to have
emerged triumphant after
years of behind-the-scenes preparation the
company last week
received the state
production license that
will allow it
to start churning
out Sildenafil citrate
the active ingredient
in Viagra guangzhou
baiyunshan a subsidiary
of the larger
guangzhou pharmaceutical holdings
limited began developing
its product in
the 1990s but
had to hold
off in 2003
when it was
unable to get
a production license
Pfizer patent nanfang
daily reported chinese
companies have spent
the better part
of two decades
lying in wait
for Pfizers patent
to expire because
profits in chinas
sector are enormous
and only expected
to grow the
investigation report on
china Sildenafil market
2009-2018 put out
by china market
research reports estimates
that more than
50 million men
in china suffer
from sexual dysfunction
the demand for
a remedy is
expected to rise
along with the
aging of chinas
population the united
nations department of
economic and social
affairs projects that
by 2050 china
will be home
to 437 million
people over the
age of 60
according to a
citigroup study cited
by cnbc the
current chinese erectile
dysfunction drug market
is worth 1
7 billion renminbi
a year this
could reach as
much as 5
billion renminbi or
$810 million by
2018 it said
and generic versions
of Viagra could
take more than
half the market
whereas Viagra is
sold in china
at more than
90 renminbi or
almost $15 a pill
baiyunshan plans to
market its own
version for between
30 to 50
renminbi giving it
a serious competitive
advantage Viagra was
introduced to china
Pfizer faced a
range of challenges
to its patent
and other litigation
until 2007 one
of the greatest
obstacles the company
faced in marketing
the drug to
chinese consumers was
that it did
not own the
trademark on its
most commonly used
chinese name wei
ge which sounds
somewhat like the
english while literally
translating to great
older brother or
big guy when
Pfizer tried to
trademark the colloquial
chinese term for
its product it
discovered that that
name was already
owned by a
local pharmaceutical company
in guangzhou and
so was left
with the lackluster
transliteration wan ai
ke which has
no particular chinese
meaning baiyunshan clearly
seeks to mimic
the mainland success
of wei ge
by naming its
product jin ge
which means golden
dagger-ax this serves
up a witty
reference to Pfizers
big guy in
terms of pronunciation
while conjuring the
image of the
phallic l-shaped blade favored
by warriors in
the shang through
han dynasties this
clear mimicry in
both product and
marketing is an
indication however of
the chinese pharmaceutical
industrys weakness according
to an article
in china youth
daily it quoted
long yongtu who
was the lead
negotiator on chinas
entry into the
world trade organization
as saying in
2006 that 90
5 000 or
so large and
small pharmaceutical companies
in china produced
only generics and
their combined annual
sales revenue totaled
less than $40 billion less
than that of
a single company
of Pfizers size
in 2013 Pfizer
took in $51 3 billion
globally nearly a
decade later chinese
pharmaceutical companies are
still more eager
to imitate than
innovate shying away
from the huge
investments and risks
of developing new
drugs in favor
of the certain
returns from imitating
tried-and-true blockbuster drugs
or repackaging existing
formulas according to
china youth daily
chinese pharmaceuticals on
average still invest
less than 1
percent of their
budget in research
and development despite
recent government incentives
generics are nonetheless
better alternatives for
penny-pinching consumers than
the knock-offs that abound
they are subject
to governmental regulation
and contain the
same active ingredients
and dosage as
the original drug
time will tell
if those who
prefer traditional chinese
medicine virility treatments
such as pangolin
scales or tiger
penis will be
swayed by the
new golden dagger-ax on the
market a british
court today invalidated
one of the
patents that Pfizer
inc holds on
its blockbuster anti-impotence drug Viagra
a more basic
patent protecting the
active ingredient in
Viagra was unaffected
the overturned patent
was an unusually
broad one covering
any drug that
acts by blocking
the action of
the phosphodiesterase enzyme
a class of
drugs called pde-5 inhibitors the
decision means other
companies can freely
develop and market
such drugs in
britain but the
particular pde-5 inhibitor used
in Viagra a
chemical known as
Sildenafil remains protected
by an unchallenged
british patent that
will not expire
until 2013 no
competing pde-5 inhibitors are
ready to be
marketed as anti-impotence drugs but
eli lilly and
the icos corporation
is working on
one called Cialis
and Bayer a
g is expected
drug called vardenafil
in 2002 the
court found that
Pfizer's pde-5 inhibitor patent
was based on
information that was
already in the
public domain when
the patent was
granted in 1993
the treatment for
erectile dysfunction was
revolutionized with the
development of phosphodiesterase
type 5 inhibitors
Tadalafil is the
newest and most
versatile pde5 inhibitor
in the clinical
armamentarium for the
treatment of ed
its most unique
characteristic is its
long half-life of 17
5 hours which
lends itself to
a longer therapeutic
window with on-demand dosing and
effective steady-state plasma concentrations
with once-daily dosing clinical
trials have proven
its safety and
efficacy with both
dosing strategies for
all severities and
etiologies of ed
including difficult-to-treat ed this
thorough review will
discuss ed the
physiology of penile
erection and the
role of pde5
and all aspects
of Tadalafil from
its development through
its pharmacology to
its latest clinical
studies and indications
the last two
decades have seen
a dramatic growth
of understanding in
the physiology of
erection the pathophysiology
of erectile dysfunction
and its treatment
options as the
above quote from
the fifth edition
of campbells urology
reveals it was
not long ago
when little was
known of erectile
physiology and adequate
treatment was still
some day away
prior to the
turn of the
century the pharmacologic
treatment options for
ed were cumbersome
and invasive limited
to intracavernosal injections
or intraurethral pellets
everything changed when
oral phosphodiesterase type
5 inhibitors became
available completely revolutionizing
ed of all
severities and etiologies
Pfizer introduced the
first pde5 inhibitor
Sildenafil in march
of 1998 and
over the past
10 years the
new oral pharmacologic
therapy together with
an unbridled acceptance
and newfound candor
by the general
public has not
only dramatically increased
the awareness and
prevalence of ed
but also made
treatment of the
disease simple and
effective once one
of the most
frustrating and refractory
diseases for the
urologic speCialist ed
is now enthusiastically
discussed and treated
in the primary
care setting the
addition of two
more pde5 inhibitors
to the market
in 2003 broadened
the landscape of
ed treatment and
solidified pde5 inhibitors
as safe and
effective first-line treatments for
ed with the
development of the
new pde5 inhibitors
attention was focused
on increased potency
duration of action
Tadalafil the newest
of the three
available pde5 inhibitors
is similar to
Sildenafil and vardenafil
in its mechanism
of action but
differs primarily in
its longer duration
of action in
january 2008 eli
lilly announced the
latest innovation in
ed federal drug
administration approval for
Tadalafil once-daily dosing in
ed in this
review we will
highlight ed the
before focusing on
the newest and
most versatile pde5
inhibitor we intend
to thoroughly report
Tadalafils pharmacology safety
and drug interactions
its efficacy indications
and clinical trials
and its favorability
by patients and
partners the reasons
why Tadalafil is
a distinct efficacious
and favorable treatment
will be clear
at the conclusion
of this review
ed is the
inability to achieve
and maintain an
erection sufficient to
permit satisfactory sexual
intercourse affecting 150
million men worldwide
ed is growing
rapidly and its
prevalence is expected
to double to
greater than 300
over the next
20 years according
to data extrapolated
from the massachusetts
male aging study
the incidence of
ed is increasing
at an astronomical
rate with an
expected incidence of
over 600 000
new cases per
year in white
men aged 40
to 69 alone
despite its growing
incidence which is
partly a result
of the sexual
awakening stimulated by
the new pharmacologic
therapies ed remains
underdiagnosed with millions
of men worldwide
never coming to
medical attention because
of the sensitivity
of the issue
the pathophysiology of
ed has a
variety of etiologies
including psychological hormonal
neurogenic vasculogenic
drug-induced or cavernosal
impairment from any
of the aforementioned
factors the etiologies
are frequently categorized
into psychogenic organic
or the most
common type of
ed which is
a mixed psychogenic
and organic type
the pharmacologic evolution
that has occurred
several decades has
directed the current
understanding of the
pathophysiology of the
disease process until
the 1980s the
treatment options were
limited to psychosexual
therapy and placement
of penile implants
and through that
time it was
believed that ed
was primarily due
to psychogenic causes
with the introduction
of Prostaglandin intracavernosal
injections in the
late 1980s the
vasculogenic etiologies of
ed became better
understood and the
connection between late
onset hypogonadism and
ed led to
research elucidating the
hormonal etiologies of
the condition finally
the new oral
treatment with pde5
inhibitors has led
to the current
pathophysiology of ed
erection a penile
erection is a
transformation of erectile
tissue and vasculature
from a state
of minimally-perfused flaccidity into
an engorged state
it is mediated
by a multifaceted
succession of neural
and vascular components
coupled with hormonal
and psychological factors
through complex neural
pathways consisting of
somatic sensory afferent
and autonomic nerves
supraspinal structures including
the medial preoptic
area and paraventricular
nucleus of the
hypothalamus sexual arousal
stimulates the release
of neurotransmitters that
initiate erection the
primary erectile-mediating neurotransmitter is
nitric oxide a
short-lived gaseous mediator
no is synthesized
in nonadrenergic noncholinergic
fashion by neuronal
nitric oxide synthase
in the cavernous
nerves to initiate
erection and by
endothelial nitric oxide
synthase in the
endothelium to maintain
erection during sexual
stimulation no passively
crosses the cell
membrane and activates
soluble guanylyl cyclase
upon entering smooth
muscle cytoplasm which
in turn increases
the production of
cyclic guanosine monophosphate
by converting it
from guanosine triphosphate
the increased concentration
of cgmp activates
protein kinase g
also called cgmp-dependent kinase which
through phosphorylation of
ion channels opens
potassium channels and
inhibits calcium channels
the resultant decrease
in cytosolic calcium
concentration favors smooth
muscle relaxation the
vascular smooth muscle
relaxation simultaneously vasodilates
arterioles and trabecular
smooth muscle sinusoids
within erectile tissue
to increase penile
blood flow subsequently
compression of the
subtunical venules against
the tunica albuginea
occludes venous outflow
during the final
phase of rigid
erection robust contraction
of the ischiocavernous
muscles constricts the
base of the
blood-filled corpora cavernosa
causing the penis
to become even
harder arterial inflow
and venous outflow
are temporarily occluded
during this phase
and the intracavernous
pressure can approach
several hundred millimeters
of mercury detumescence
results from sympathetic
discharge with ejaculation
at the molecular
level with the
cessation of no
release from the
endothelium and the
breakdown of cgmp
and other secondary
messengers by various
phosphodiesterase enzymes pde
is an enzyme
that 50 years
ago was discovered
to block the
activity of the
second messenger cyclic
adenosine 3 5-monophosphate in animal
models the pde
superfamily includes 11
families pde1 to
pde11 on 21
unique genes they
are distributed throughout
various tissues primarily
in vascular visceral
and pulmonary smooth
muscle and they
regulate physiologic functions
in multiple organ
systems in the
penis pde acts
to breakdown cgmp
despite the observation
that every family
of pde except
pde6 has been
found in the
corpus cavernosum pde5
is the most
abundant pde family
in the penis
by inhibiting the
pde5 inhibitors create
increased bioavailability of
cgmp which both
facilitates and potentiates
the no-mediated relaxation of
erectile smooth muscle
with sexual stimulation
caffeine and theophylline
were two of
the first drugs
found to inhibit
the pde enzyme
decades ago over
the past 30
years inhibitors of
several families of
pde have been
developed to treat
diseases these include
the pde3 inhibitors
milrinone and amrinone
developed in the
1980s for heart
failure a pde4
inhibitor cilostazol developed
for claudication and
the anti-platelet drug dipyridamole
that inhibits pde8
pde9 and pde5
Papaverine was the
first pde inhibitor
used in the
and it is
still used in
practice today administered
as an intracorporal
injection Papaverine is
a non-selective inhibitor of
pde3 and its
isoforms originally investigated
as a treatment
for angina pectoris
the first oral
pde5 inhibitor Sildenafil
was fortuitously discovered
to produce erections
in study participants
it was later
released in 1998
as the first
oral treatment for
ed and this
was followed in
2003 by the
release of two
vardenafil and Tadalafil
the bothell Washington-based
pharmacologic research
company icos corporation
was started in
1990 and it
began the initial
cardiovascular testing of
called ic351 in
1993 meanwhile Sildenafil
citrate was discovered
to cause improved
erectile function as
a side effect
in a trial
testing its efficacy
of angina pectoris
in 1994 ic351
was patented that
year and phase
i clinical trials
began in 1995
two years later
phase ii clinical
trials began on
patients with ed
the same year
that the fda
approved Sildenafil as
the first pde5
inhibitor for the
company joined the
icos corporation to
form lilly icos
llc in 1998
to expand the
marketing venture of
the newest pde5
inhibitor Tadalafil was
officially born in
the year 2000
when a new
drug application was
put forth for
ic351 with the
generic name Tadalafil
and trade name
Cialis in may
2002 the first
reports regarding the
efficacy and duration
of action of
Tadalafil for ed
were presented at
the 97th annual
meeting of the
american urological association
in orlando florida
USA brock and
colleagues presented their
initial data supporting
the efficacy and
safety of Tadalafil
and porst and
colleagues presented that
Tadalafil is efficacious
for up to
36 hours brocks
data were published
later that year
in a landmark
integrative analysis of
five randomized controlled
trials of Tadalafil
that ultimately led
to the approval
Tadalafil was approved
for use in
europe in late
2002 and on
november 21 2003
by the fda
the three available
pde5 inhibitors share
a similar mechanism
they have structural
pharmacologic and clinical
differences the molecular
structure of Tadalafil
is available in
figure 1 Tadalafils
molecular structure is
different than the
similar structures of
all three have
a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing
doublering system
with a central
ring that is
analogous to that
of cgmp and
allows for competitive
binding of the
drug with pde5
at the catalytic
site Tadalafil is
different in that
β-carboline-type pde5 inhibitor
with a piperazinedione
ring formed from
a modification of
the hydantoin ring
of Sildenafil Tadalafil
is at least
9000 times more
selective for pde5
than most of
the other families
of pdes with
the exception of
pde11 pde11 is
testes and prostate
however despite partial
inhibition of pde11
by Tadalafil at
therapeutic doses clinical
significance of this
observation has yet
to be fully
understood a study
by hellstrom and
colleagues concluded that
there are no
harmful effects of
Tadalafil on spermatogenesis
or testicular function
responsible for phototransduction
in the retina
pde6 is inhibited
to some degree
by Sildenafil and
vardenafil but not
Tadalafil the inhibition
of pde6 explains
the side effect
of blue vision
experienced by some
patients with these
two drugs as
pde6 inhibition in
the retina causes
impairment of blue-green color discrimination
slightly less common
with vardenafil altered
vision is a
reported side effect
for 11% of men taking
Sildenafil 100 mg
compared with Sildenafil
and vardenafil Tadalafil
is much less
inhibitory for pde6
over 700 times
more potent for
pde5 than pde6
Tadalafil has less
than 0 1% occurrence of vision
abnormalities recommended starting
doses of Tadalafil
are 10 mg
for on-demand dosing and
2 5 mg
for once-daily dosing and
these doses can
then be titrated
up or down
it is absorbed
as a low-solubility and
high-permeability or class
2 drug within
the FDA biopharmaceuticals
classification system with
oral ingestion after
first-pass metabolism Tadalafil
is approximately 80% bioavailable compared to
40% and 15% with Sildenafil and
vardenafil respectively Tadalafil
has the slowest
absorption of the
with a mean
of 2 hours
to reach its
maximum concentration compared
with about 50
minutes for Sildenafil
and vardenafil the
onset of action
of Tadalafil may
occur in as
early as 15
minutes of dosing
although successful erections
occur in fewer
than 40% of men at
this time point
it is not
advisable to counsel
patients that the
drug effect may
be seen in
as early as
15 minutes because
it may take
up to 2
hours for a
response in the
majority of men
this may only
create performance anxiety
or loss of
confidence in the
treatment leading to
treatment failure differences
in gastrointestinal absorption
with fatty meals
explain the varying
peak plasma concentration
among the three
pde5 inhibitors while
both have decreased
absorption when taken
with a fatty
meal which may
increase the rate
of treatment failure
the absorption of
Tadalafil is unaffected
by fatty meals
or alcohol consumption
this unique pharmacokinetic
trait for Tadalafil
is a result
of slower absorption
and longer half-life and it
can therefore be
taken with meals
or alcohol without
a decrease in
efficacy among the
three pde5 inhibitors
the half-life and thus
is the pharmacologic
parameter that is
the most strikingly
dissimilar the half-life of Tadalafil
is 17 5
hours in normal
healthy men and
21 6 hours
in elderly men
while the half-lives of Sildenafil
and vardenafil are
similar at 4
hours this longer
half-life provides a
therapeutic window of
36 hours for
Tadalafil the risks
of a longer
half-life have yet
to be completely
elucidated but there
does not appear
to be any
higher mortality with
Tadalafil compared to
the other pde5
inhibitors one difference
resulting from the
half-life disparity is
that emergent treatment
with nitrate medications
must be deferred
48 hours after
ingestion of Tadalafil
compared with 24
hours for Sildenafil
and vardenafil pharmacologic
treatments for ed
prior to Tadalafil
including Prostaglandin intracavernosal
injections or intra-urethral pellets as
well as the
other two pde5
inhibitors all have
a short half-life for this
reason historically it
has been necessary
for ed treatments
to be dosed
immediately prior to
attempting intercourse a
drawback to this
necessary dosing schedule
for short half-life ed treatments
is potential performance
anxiety the therapeutic
window of 36
hours of Tadalafil
allows the patient
more freedom to
choose the timing
and setting of
the sexual encounter
with his partner
other benefits of
Tadalafils longer half-life are still
being explored the
FDA recently expanded
the indications for
Tadalafil to once-daily dosing for
ed the longer
steady state of
serum drug concentration
with low dose
once-daily administration a
benefit not shared
with the other
two pde5 inhibitors
the metabolism of
Tadalafil is via
the hepatic enzyme
cytochrome p450 34a
to a catechol
metabolite which undergoes
further metabolism to
its primary circulating
metabolite methylcatechol glucuronide
a 10 000-fold less potent
molecule than Tadalafil
the cyp34a metabolism
pathway of Tadalafil
was verified with
studies using a
cyp34a inhibitor ketoconazole
and a cyp34a
inducer rifampin Tadalafil
is excreted largely
as metabolites approximately
two-thirds into the
feces and one-third into the
urine although frequently
asked about by
patients priapism is
rarely associated with
pde5 inhibitors several
case reports have
found an extraordinarily
uncommon link between
Sildenafil and priapism
and only a
single case report
exists in the
literature implicating Tadalafil
with priapism pde5
inhibitors including Tadalafil
may actually have
some benefit in
preventing recurrent or
stuttering priapism a
small series of
4 men with
stuttering priapism were
administered daily pde5
inhibitors one case
of which used
Tadalafil and all
four men had
decreases in priapism
recurrences safety and
drug interactions as
with every pde5
inhibitor Tadalafil is
absolutely contraindicated with
nitrate medications for
angina pectoris secondary
to the potentiated
hypotensive effect the
drugs can have
together because of
the longer half-life treatment with
nitrate medications must
be deferred for
at least 48
hours after ingestion
of Tadalafil compared
with 24 hours
for Sildenafil and
vardenafil the cardiac
effects of pde5
inhibitors have received
considerable attention because
the drugs were
originally studied as
a treatment for
to their action
of smooth muscle
relaxation all of
the pde5 inhibitor
trials have tediously
monitored study participants
vital signs particularly
heart rate and
blood pressure monitored
drug effects on
cardiac electrophysiology and
tabulated the numbers
of cardiovascular adverse
events in a
review of more
than 4000 patients
from over 60
studies data reported
by kloner and
co-workers contended that
Tadalafil does cause
small changes in
blood pressure secondary
to its vasodilatory
properties but that
the changes were
not clinically meaningful
in a separate
more recent study
the same author
retrospectively reviewed serious
cardiovascular treatment-emergent adverse events
reported in 36
Tadalafil trials and
found that the
incidence of these
events were comparable
among patients taking
Tadalafil as needed
3 times per
week once-daily and placebo
the second princeton
consensus conference an
expert conference on
sexual dysfunction and
cardiac risk convened
in 2004 to
develop practice guidelines
for the management
of ed in
patients with significant
cardiac risk after
reviewing all available
literature the second
princeton consensus conference
not only determined
that patients with
significant cardiac risk
factors did not
exhibit worsening ischemia
or unstable hemodynamics
while taking pde5
inhibitors but also
that cardiovascular function
was actually improved
by pde5 inhibitors
in some studies
although reported with
vardenafil prolongation of
the qtc interval
is not observed
with Tadalafil Tadalafil
does not cause
increased hypotension or
orthostatic hypotension in
men that are
also taking multiple
antihypertensive medications and
it is safe
and well tolerated
in this population
the primary exception
is with α-blockers frequently prescribed
for men with
hypertension α-blockers share a
similar mechanism of
action with pde5
inhibitors through peripheral
vasodilation and may
have more of
an additive effect
than other antihypertensives
recently the fda
changed its previous
recommendation from contraindicated
co-administration to precautionary
co-administration in a
study of the
blood pressure effects
of Tadalafil coupled
with either of
two α-blockers doxazosin and
tamsulosin the hypotensive
effect of doxazosin
was exaggerated by
almost 10 mmhg
with Tadalafil while
there was no
change in blood
pressure with tamsulosin
and Tadalafil the
authors concluded tamsulosin
to be a
safe α-blocker to administer
concurrently with Tadalafil
until more studies
are available precaution
is recommended with
the co-administration of Tadalafil
with any α-blocker including mixed
α-blockers such as
labetalol and carvedilol
because of its
metabolism through the
cytochrome p450 pathway
Tadalafil is susceptible
to changes in
serum concentration by
other drugs that
inhibit or promote
its metabolism inhibitors
of the cyp34a
enzyme include ketoconazole
erythromycin grapefruit juice
and protease inhibitors
and co-administration of these
drugs with Tadalafil
may increase serum
concentrations of Tadalafil
on the contrary
co-administration with inducers
of cyp34a including
rifampin carbamazepine phenytoin
and phenobarbital would
require a larger
dose of Tadalafil
for a similar
clinical effect Tadalafil
is an efficacious
treatment for ed
of all severities
and etiologies the
largest data series
exist for the
general ed population
with mild to
moderate ed but
Tadalafil has also
been shown to
be an effective
treatment for difficult-to-treat ed such
as more severe
organic ed evaluated
in tertiary care
centers ed secondary
to diabetes mellitus
and ed resulting
from prostate cancer
treatments such as
prostatectomy and radiotherapy
several recent studies
have shown a
significant treatment benefit
from once-daily low-dose Tadalafil these
studies have lead
to the most
recent development in
ed once-daily Tadalafil for
ed which was
fda-approved in 2008
although the effectiveness
of pde5 inhibitors
on such intermediate
objective outcomes as
penile rigidity through
penile plethysmography with
the rigiscan device
has been studied
measuring the therapeutic
effectiveness of Tadalafil
is more accurately
defined through an
integration of the
patients reported treatment
response and tolerability
with the reported
satisfaction of both
the patient and
his partner despite
their intrinsically subjective
nature validated questionnaires
are the preferred
major outcome measure
of treatment effectiveness
of Tadalafil and
other pde5 inhibitors
was developed by
rosen and colleagues
in 1997 as
a multidimensional 15-item
self-administered questionnaire with
the goal of
assessing five domains
of male sexual
function including erectile
function orgasmic function
sexual desire intercourse
satisfaction and overall
satisfaction the erectile
function domain of
the iief contains
6 questions which
the patient answers
on a scale
from 1 to
5 providing a
total score of
6 to 30
points the questions
concern erectile frequency
firmness penetration ability
maintenance frequency maintenance
ability and erection

more reliably assesses
his partners satisfaction
with ed treatments
and explores the
impact of patient

on treatment continuation
graded on a

or higher indicates
treatment satisfaction in
addition to the
iief and the
sep many Tadalafil
trials report a
global overall assessment
as provided by
the patient known
as a global
assessment question it
is a summary
question to assess
global improvement and
to provide an
indirect estimate of
patient satisfaction a
frequently reported gaq
in Tadalafil trials
is did the
treatment improve your
erections? the most frequently
referenced study supporting
the efficacy of
Tadalafil is an
integrated analysis of
5 randomized double-blind placebo controlled
multicentered phase iii
trials from 1112
men at 74
centers worldwide the
average age was
59 and the
etiology of ed
was 61% organic 9% psychogenic

41% moderate in 23% and severe in
36% subjects were randomized
to placebo or
Tadalafil at doses
from 2 5
mg to 20

to self-administer a dose
before initiating intercourse
up to once
daily iief-ef sep and
gaq scores were
assessed at baseline
and at 12
weeks results of
the integrated analysis
found all doses
of Tadalafil to

of all ages
in the general
population bagdanda nepal
— from a pasture
high in the
himalayas tulsingh rokaya
55 a shepherd
watched for years
as the number
of itinerant harvesters
swelled they came
in search of
what is known
as caterpillar fungus
or yarsagumba in
nepali a parasitic
fungus it forms
out of the
head of ghost
moth larvae living
in the soil
at altitudes above
10 000 feet
and has been
used as an
aphrodisiac for at
least a thousand
years earning it
the nickname himalayan
Viagra in the
1980s the pickers
used to trade
the fungus for
cigarettes and noodles
but as yarsagumba
grew in popularity
it exploded into
a multibillion-dollar industry spanning
china Singapore and
during the picking
season which runs
from late may
to july the
number of harvesters
in bagdanda and
two neighboring camps
has often reached
several thousands of
people but this
season with the
fungus becoming scarce
the number is
down to the
hundreds they still
hike from a
camp below carrying
metal picks to
dig out the
fungus helping to
produce an average
regional harvest of
135 tons a
year occasionally they
stop at mr
rokayas tent to
buy sheeps curd
most of the
time they pass
through teetering on
a steep hillside
where they spend
the morning hunched
over to find
the funguss crooked
black stem poking
through the dirt
folklore has it
that interest in
the fungus stems
from the startling
performance of chinese
runners at an
international track meet
in 1993 which
their coach attributed
to their consumption
of a soup
combining the fungus
with turtle blood
with prices topping
$50 000 a
pound in chinas
coastal megacities harvesting
of the fungus
has helped to
curb endemic poverty
in the himalayas
which stretch across
nepal northern India
bhutan tibet and
china for hundreds
of thousands of
people living in
remote villages selling
yarsagumba has become
a primary source
of income a
study by nepals
central bank found
that harvesters earned
about $2 500 or
their yearly income
selling the fungus
money from yarsagumba
has given some
of the worlds
most impoverished people
access to electricity
hospital care and
education the whole
tibetan plateau is
by now completely
dependent on the
cash influx said
daniel winkler a
mycologist who has
studied the caterpillar
fungus extensively in
tibet he estimated
that over one
million people in
tibet sell the
fungus health insurance
companies buy prescription
drugs the way
u s consumers
buy cars: theres the sticker
price and theres
the negotiated price
the pharmaceutical industry
has long said
that list prices
arent a reliable
indicator of what
americans pay for
prescription drugs because
big customers including
health insurers and
pharmacy benefit managers
negotiate discounts but
a Bloomberg analysis
of 39 medicines
with global sales
of more than
$1 billion a
year showed that
30 of them
logged price increases
double the rate
of inflation from
2009 to 2015
even after estimated
discounts were factored
in only six
drugs had price
increases in line
with or below
inflation the analysis
is based on
discount estimates from
ssr health an
investment research firm
that compared estimates
of gross sales
for each drug
based on prescription

ssr healths estimates
for discounts with

the drugs supplied
by connecture inc
which provides price-comparison software to
health plans many
drug companies disputed
the analysis but
none provided specific
data to counter
it discounts vary
dramatically depending on
disease type and
how much competition
exists take humalog
the popular short-acting insulin made
by eli lilly
& co its big
list price increases
were wiped out
by ever-bigger discounts humalog
faces competition from
a very similar
drug: novolog from novo
nordisk a/s benefit managers
have been playing
one company against
the other to
get cheaper prices
lilly offered discounts
of 66 percent
on humalog last
year up from
23 percent in
2009 according to
ssr health estimates
discounts for novolog
have risen in
parallel fashion since
2012 the data
show lilly said
it doesnt disclose
rebates for individual
drugs but on
average its discounts
are 35 percent
for commercial insurance
plans and 80
percent for government
plans novo nordisk
said u s
discounts for all
of its medicines
were over 50
percent last year

35 percent in

and enbrel the
bestselling rheumatoid arthritis
medications from abbvie
inc and amgen
inc respectively makers
of these arthritis
drugs have tremendous
pricing power said
ssr health analyst
richard evans thats
in large part
because doctors are
reluctant to switch
to cheaper drugs
when their patients
symptoms are controlled
via the popular
therapies this largely
allows companies to
keep the price
increases he said
amgen said its
contracts with insurers
prohibit it from
discussing rebate levels
while abbvie declined
to comment on
its rebates in
some cases drugmakers
have been offering
larger discounts but
not enough to
keep up with
list price gains
Pfizer increased the
discount on its
lyrica drug for
fibromyalgia to 33
yet list prices
have risen 145
percent in six
years the drug
has relatively few
close competitors making
it harder for
insurers to remove
from coverage lists
Pfizer said that
the calculations significantly
underestimate its rebates
and discounts without
providing alternate numbers
a small number
of other drugs
including biogen inc
s multiple sclerosis
drug avonex have
been able to
push through big
price hikes while
simultaneously reducing discounts
ssr health data
demand for avonex
has declined as
biogen focuses on
its newer multiple
sclerosis drugs the
remaining patients still
on the drug
are unlikely to
switch to alternatives
said ssr healths
evans the estimated
price after discounts
has more than
tripled in six
years biogen said
Bloombergs method does
not give proper
estimates of discount
levels actual rebate
figures are proprietary
the company said
companies was prepared
to confirm the
data and many
other companies including
johnson & johnson roche holding
ag glaxosmithkline plc
novartis ag and
bristol-myers squibb co
also disputed the
analysis saying it
underestimated rebates failed
to capture certain
sales channels overestimated

the study also
encompassed drugs from
astellas pharma inc
astrazeneca plc daiichi
sankyo co gilead
sciences inc merck

plc those companies
either declined to
comment on rebates
or said their
discounts were confidential
sanofi said that
it has increased
rebate amounts in
recent years in
order to maintain
favorable coverage daiichi
sankyo said that
Bloombergs general approach
was inaccurate gilead
sciences said its
hiv drug price
increases would not
apply to u
s hiv patients
who get drugs
through certain government
programs two industry
trade groups the
pharmaceutical research and
manufacturers of america
and the biotechnology
innovation organization pointed
to ims health
holdings data showing
that discounted prices
didn't rise as
much last year
as in previous
years they said
that cherry picking
specific drugs fails
to show how
the market really
works and to
take into account
the competition from
generics growth in
prescription drug prices

line with other
health-care prices phrma

5 percent during
this period besides
humira and enbrel

doubled for seven
drugs including merck

Pfizer inc s

overall discounts on
the 39 drugs
rose from 20
percent on average
in 2009 to
almost 37 percent
in 2015 Bloomberg
also looked at

for many of
them rebate data

back to 2012
so they were
not included in

drugs showed similar
pricing patterns with
most gaining significantly
faster than inflation
and a much
smaller number failing

varied sharply by
disease the rebates

20 percent in
2015 for cancer

of pricey drugs
for which insurers
are reluctant to

lamar odom's collapse this
week – after allegedly using
cocaine and sexual
supplements – has raised questions
about the supplements
and their safety
and whether they
could increase the
dangers posed by
illegal drugs odom
is now on
life support at
a nevada hospital
USA today's liz szabo
talked to medical
experts about these
products q what
is in a
sexual performance supplement? a although these
supplements are often
called herbal Viagra
– suggesting that they
contain a safer
or more natural
form of the
little blue pill
– many contain the
real Viagra according
to the food
odom apparently took
supplements called reload
72-hour strong and
libimax according a
spokesman for the
legal nevada brothel
where he collapsed
who spoke to
the associated press
tests by the
FDA in 2013
found Sildenafil Viagra's active ingredient
in reload in
2009 the manufacturer
of libimax recalled
the product after
tests found that
it contained Tadalafil
another drug for
erectile dysfunction problems
aren't limited to
libimax and reload
found that 300
sexual supplements contain
unidentified ingredients not
only do these
products contain undisclosed
drug ingredients the
FDA says on
its website but
they also sometimes
may include combinations
of undisclosed ingredients
or excessively high
doses both potentially
dangerous situations some
herbal sexual supplements
also contain saw
palmetto ginseng and
horny goat weed
used for centuries
in china to
treat low libido
and erectile dysfunction
others contain yohimbine
made from the
bark of a
type of evergreen
tree said pieter
cohen an assistant
professor at harvard
medical school taking
a sexual supplement
is like playing
russian roulette said
robert glatter an
emergency physician at
lenox hill hospital
in new york
city you don't know what
you're getting any
time you open
a bottle ofherbal
Viagra q why
would supplement makers
put an expensive
drug like Viagra
which can sell
for $5 to $10 a pill
into an herbal
supplement? a although Viagra
is expensive in
the USA it's dirt cheap
in china which
makes many of
these supplements cohen
said chinese companies
sell sexual supplements
for a fraction
of the cost
of Viagra but
can still make
a profit unlike
Viagra however which
comes in a
standard dose supplements
may not have
a standard dose
of medication so
men could get
much less of
they're looking for
or much more
q how risky
are these supplements? a according to
the FDA the
hidden ingredients in
these supplements can
pose life-threatening risks that's because the
active ingredients in
can interact with
prescription drugs such
as nitroglycerin used
to treat chest
pain and other
heart problems according
to the fda
that's a big
risk given that
the older men
who seek out
are often the
same ones who
take nitroglycerin including
high cholesterol or
heart disease both
Viagra-like drugs and
nitroglycerin lower blood
pressure glatter said
taken together the
combination can cause
heart attacks and
strokes in its
2013 warning about
reload the fda
said: consumers should stop
using this product
immediately and throw
it away consumers
who have experienced
any negative side
effects should consult
a health care
professional as soon
as possible even
prescription erectile dysfunction
drugs such as
Viagra which are
regulated much more
tightly than herbal
supplements can cause
heart attacks glatter
said sexual supplements
that contain Viagra-like drugs are
especially risky if
men take large
doses glatter said
odom reportedly took
10 of the
pills consumers should
be skeptical about
claims that appear
too good to
be true said
craig hopp program
director of extramural
research the national
center for complementary
and integrative health
part of the
national institutes of
health some herbal
sexual supplements promise
results in 30
minutes for example
while pharmaceuticals can
work that quickly
hopp said that
plants don't supplements that
claim to work
as quickly as
drugs are probably
laced with drugs
q do sexual
supplements work? a no supplements
have ever been
shown to be
effective for erectile
dysfunction according to
the national center
for complementary and
integrative health unlike
prescription drugs which
must prove they're safe and
effective before being
approved by the
FDA supplement makers
don't have to
prove that their
products work before
selling them said
charles bell programs
director for consumers
union the advocacy
arm of consumer
reports magazine because
supplements aren't tested through
a rigorous scientific
process consumers have
no way to
know if they
really work q
are supplements riskier
than prescription or
over-the-counter erectile dysfunction
drugs? a unlike prescription
and over-the-counter drugs supplement
makers aren't required to
post warnings about
such side effects
or drug interactions
on their product
labels bell said
many men may
not realize the
risks sexual supplements
can sometimes be
much stronger than
regular Viagra glatter
said you take
more and more
pills thinking it's safe glatter
said people think
it's natural so
it must be
safe a study
in the new
england journal of
medicine this week
found that at
least 23 000
americans go to
the emergency room
– including 2 000
who are hospitalized
– after taking dietary
supplements many of
the most common
symptoms are heart
palpitations a absolutely
glatter said cocaine
alone is dangerous
and can cause
a heart attack
a stimulant raises
makes the heart
beat faster but
it decreases the
blood supply to
the coronary arteries
that supply the
heart with oxygen
cocaine is also
particularly dangerous when
combined with alcohol
said glatter who
noted that some
people combine the
two in order
to soften the
experience of coming
down off cocaine
combining cocaine and
Viagra can cause
a life-threatening excruciatingly painful
condition called an
aortic dissection or
tear in the
wall of the
body's main artery
glatter said this
causes blood to
bleed into the
blood vessel wall
– instead of flowing
out to the
body – which deprives the
brain and extremities
of oxygen that
in turn can
cause a stroke
people with this
condition can also
lose a leg
the results of
odom's toxicology tests
have not yet
been released god
knows what this
guy took glatter
said adding the
club drug ecstasy
which is often
taken to boost
a sexual experience
only increases the
risks from Viagra-like drugs glatter
said combining ecstasy
with alcohol and
serotonin syndrome causing
confusion seizures and
a high body
temperature that in
turn also can
lead to stroke
sexual enhancement supplements
– like those reportedly
taken by lamar
odom before he
collapsed at a
nevada brothel – are often spiked
with powerful and
hidden pharmaceuticals despite
labels claiming they
only contain herbs
and other natural
ingredients experts and
regulators have warned
for years odom
took cocaine and
as many as
10 sexual–performance supplement pills
leading up to
his hospitalization in
las vegas according
to a 911
call released wednesday
by the nye
county sheriffs department
the product he
took was reload
72-hour strong sexual
performance enhancer for
men two employees
of the love
ranch said on
the 911 call
in 2013 the
FDA issued a
public warning that
consumers should not
purchase or use
a supplement called
reload because tests
found it contains
Sildenafil the active
ingredient in the
drug Viagra the
undeclared ingredient may
dangerously interact with
other drugs especially
nitrates often taken
by men with
diabetes high blood
pressure or heart
disease the fda
warned investigation in
2013 found it
difficult or impossible
to determine who
the people or
companies are behind
many of the
drug-spiked supplements detected
through a limited
testing program run
by the u
s food and
drug administration when
companies could be
identified USA today
found that many
of those caught
selling spiked supplements
are run by
people with criminal
backgrounds and regulatory
run-ins consumers buying
products from these
firms were in
some cases entrusting
their safety to
people with rap
sheets involving barbiturates
crack cocaine ecstacy
and other narcotics
arrests for selling
or possessing steroids
and human growth
hormone other supplement
company executives had
records of fraud
theft assault weapons
offenses money laundering
or other offenses
the investigation found
its rare for
supplements taken by
consumers to undergo
testing by the
FDA out of
an estimated 85
000 supplement products
on the market
the FDA told
USA today in
2013 that it
was budgeted to
run just 1
000 tests per
year the current
laws combined with
lack of regulatory
action by the
FDA have left
dangerous products on
store shelves said
pieter cohen an
assistant professor at
harvard medical school
who has published
numerous studies about
dangerous supplement products
the FDA is
simply not doing
their job products
marketed as sexual
enhancement supplements are
a very high
risk sector for
consumers cohen said
because they often
contain prescription erectile
dysfunction drugs delivered
in unpredictable doses
some contain multiple
different types of
these drugs others
contain chemical cousins
of these drugs
that have never
been tested on
humans and could
have significant safety
risks he said
under the dietary
supplement health and
education act of
1994 known by
its acronym dshea
the FDA must
show a product
is unsafe before
it can take
any action to
restrict its use
or seek its
removal from the
market products marketed
as nutritional supplements
– which range from
vitamins and minerals
to protein powders
to herbal blends
– are treated like
foods and presumed
to be all-natural and safe
unless proven otherwise
although supplements are
often sold and
used as remedies
to treat various
conditions they arent
required to prove
their safety or
effectiveness before being
sold as is
required for medications
found that products
marketed as all-natural supplements for
sexual enhancement weight
loss and bodybuilding
are among the
types most commonly
found to be
spiked with undisclosed
pharmaceuticals the fda
said in a
statement thursday that
the regulation of
dietary supplements is
extremely challenging and
that the industry
is huge and
growing — currently about $35 billion in
sales up from
about $5 8 billion
just after dshea
was enacted under
the existing law
the FDA said
it has limited
authority and faces
significant hurdles and
resource limitations in
regulating supplement products
supplement industry groups
have said the
FDA needs to
do a better
job of enforcing
the law using
authorities it already
has we don't
view the problem
as a function
of the law
because companies that
choose to spike
products with illegal
drugs will find
a way to
do so regardless
— theyre simply law
breakers said judy
blatman a senior
vice president at
the council for
responsible nutrition an
industry group it
is illegal to
sell Viagra herbal
or otherwise as
a dietary supplement
the supplement industry
for many years
has opposed efforts
to require that
supplements be registered
with the fda
so the agency
will know whats
and whats supposed
to be in
the products legislation
called the dietary
supplement labeling act
introduced in 2013
by sen dick
durbin d-ill and sen
richard blumenthal d-conn has gained
little traction the
bill seeks to
give the fda
the authority to
require manufacturers to
register products and
ingredients with the
agency and also
to provide proof
of any health
benefit claims it
also includes provisions
to require more
information on product
labels a key
goal the sponsors
have said is
to reduce the
number of drug-spiked products masquerading
as all-natural supplements this
bill which we
plan to reintroduce
is desperately needed
to improve the
currently inadequate oversight
durbin and blumenthal
joint statement thursday
Flibanserin the medicine
commonly referred to
as the Viagra
for women may
soon be available
from your doctor
but there is
still a divide
among health professionals
about whether the
little pink pill
should receive federal
drug administration approval
here's what you
about where things
stand: 1 what does
it treat? Flibanserin treats hypoactive
sexual desire disorder
in premenopausal women
hsdd is defined
by the mayo
clinic as persistent
or recurrent lack
of interest in
sex that causes
personal distress the
condition impacts one
in 10 women
according to sprout
pharmaceuticals the company
behind the new
drug 2 how
does it work? unlike Viagra which
men take immediately
before a sexual
encounter Flibanserin is
taken daily before
bedtime but the
drugs are different
in more ways
than one Viagra
works by increasing
the genitals while
Flibanserin impacts brain
chemicals Flibanserin is
designed to treat
an imbalance in
neurotransmitters that are
directly related to
sexual desire sheryl
kingsberg a clinical
psychologist and an
advisor to sprout
told USA today
network the medicine
increases dopamine and
norepinephrine and decreases
serotonin 3 when
will we know
if Flibanserin is
approved? Flibanserin could get
approval from the
FDA as soon
as august 18
the deadline for
the federal agency
to make a
decision the fda
has rejected Flibanserin
twice before citing
side-effect concerns and
doubt over effectiveness
the tipping point
this time could
be that an
FDA advisory panel
approved the drug
on june 4
with a vote
of 18 to
6 in favor
the FDA often
but not always
follows the recommendations
of its advisory
committees 4 are
the risks worth
the results? critics of Flibanserin
say the side
effects such as
drowsiness low blood
pressure fainting nausea
and dizziness are
too significant to
overlook one woman
reportedly had a
concussion when she
fainted while taking
the medicine and
hit her head
there is also
concern over the
effects being increased
when mixed with
alcohol get tired
they may lower
their blood pressure
and in very
very rare instances
they could faint
stanley althof the
center for marital
and sexual health
of south florida
network about the
pill's interaction with
alcohol women will
have to limit
and think about
their drinking if
they take this
drug althof said
althof advised sprout
and is in
favor of the
drug the only
research done on
the drug's interaction with
alcohol involved a
test with 25
people of which
23 were men
the experience of
two women is
not enough research
to conclude exactly
how Flibanserin will
affect women who
drink according to
cindy pearson the
executive director of
the national women's health network
the FDA should
not approve a
drug for women
with an alcohol
interaction study done
with men she
network there's no way
women can make
an informed decision
about that particular
risk right now
pearson a self-identified pro-sex feminist has
been outspoken against
the drug getting
FDA approval she
argues the modest
results from the
pill aren't worth the
risk of serious
side effects in
clinical trials testing
its effectiveness Flibanserin
has either failed
or barely passed
only about 10-12% of women in
trials benefitted from
taking the drug
pearson wrote in
a Washington post
op-ed against the
drug's approval those
in favor of
the pill argue
that it's not for
everyone and that
modest improvement is
meaningful for women
unsatisfied with their
sex lives 5
why does feminism
keep coming up
in the debate? women on both
sides of the
debate have claimed
approving or not
approving the drug
is a feminist
issue those in
favor of fda
approval argue that
men have had
pharmaceutical options for
sexual dysfunction for
years while women
have been largely
overlooked it's about time
women have some
choices too sprout
advisor kingsberg said
i'm glad that
we finally have
one option it
will lead to
other drugs for
female sexual dysfunction
however others argue
that rushing to
approve a drug
that has problems
isn't doing women
any favors the
gender equity argument
ignores the real
safety difference between
Flibanserin and the
drugs approved for
men: a different indication
for use specifically
the dosage and
administration the national
women's health network
wrote in a
letter circulated to
congress in june
kentucky men would
have to visit
a doctor twice
and have signed
permission from their
wives before obtaining
a prescription for
Viagra or other
such drugs for
erectile dysfunction according
to a bill
filed by a
state legislator thursday
rep mary lou
marzian a louisville
democrat the sponsor
of house bill
396 said it
is merely an
effort to protect
men's health and
ensure they are
informed about a
drug with potentially
dangerous side effects
i want to
protect these men
from themselves said
marzian a nurse
hb 396 also
specifies that only
married men may
obtain the drug
and requires a
man to make
a sworn statement
with his hand
on a bible
that he will
only use a
prescription for a
drug for erectile
dysfunction when having
sexual relations with
his current spouse
this is about
family values marzian
said but she
acknowledged the bill
is a pointed
response to several
anti-abortion measures in
the current legislative
session including senate
bill 4 which
requires a woman
seeking an abortion
to get counseling
24 hours in
advance of the
procedure from a
health professional the
counseling must be
in person or
via live telecommunications
sb 4 called
the informed consent
bill passed last
week and was
signed into law
by gov matt
bevin marzian an
abortion-rights supporter said
is meant to
protest intervention by
a predominantly male
general assembly into
women's health do
we really want
a bunch or
legislators interfering in
private personal medical
decisions? she asked marzian
said she doesn't expect her
bill to get
very far but
she's not done
marzian said she
also plans to
file a bill
requiring potential gun
buyers to obtain
counseling 24 hours
in advance from
victims of gun
violence before the
purchase i'm just making
sure the government
is taking care
of your safety
she said men
who are bashful
about needing help
in the bedroom
no longer have
to go to
the drugstore to
buy that little
blue pill in
a first for
the drug industry
Pfizer inc told
that the drugmaker
will begin selling
its popular erectile
dysfunction pill Viagra
directly to patients
on its website
men still will
need a prescription
to buy the
blue diamond-shaped pill on
Viagra com but
they no longer
have to face
a pharmacist to
get it filled
and for those
who are bothered
by Viagra's steep $25-a-pill price Pfizer
is offering three
free pills with
the first order
and 30% off the second
one Pfizer's bold move
blows up the
drug industry's distribution model
drugmakers don't sell medicines
instead they sell
in bulk to
wholesalers who then
distribute the drugs
to pharmacies hospitals
and doctorsoffices but
the world's second-largest drugmaker is
trying a new
strategy to tackle
a problem that
plagues the industry
unscrupulous online pharmacies
increasingly offer patients
counterfeit versions of
Viagra and other
brand-name drugs for
up to 95% off with no
prescription needed patients
don't realize the
drugs are fake
or that legitimate
pharmacies require a
prescription other major
drugmakers likely will
watch Pfizer's move closely
if it works
drugmakers could begin
selling other medicines
that are rampantly
counterfeited and sold
online particularly treatments
for non-urgent conditions seen
as embarrassing think: diet drugs medicines
for baldness and
birth control pills
everybody will hop
on the train
says les funtleyder
strategist at private
equity fund poliwogg
who believes Pfizer's site will
attract fence-sitters who are
nervous about buying
online the online
Viagra sales are
Pfizer's latest effort
to combat a
problem that has
grown with the
popularity of the
internet in recent
years americans have
become more comfortable
with online shopping
with many even
buying prescription drugs
online that's particularly true
for those who
don't have insurance
are bargain hunters
or want to
keep their medicine
purchases private few
realize that the
vast majority of
online pharmacies don't follow the
rules the internet
is filled with
illegitimate websites that
lure customers with
spam emails and
professional-looking websites that
run 24-hour call centers
a january study
by the national
association of boards
of pharmacy which
accredits online pharmacies
found that only
257 of 10
275 online pharmacy
sites it examined
appeared legitimate experts
say the fake
drugs such websites
sell can be
dangerous that's because they
don't include the
right amount of
if any or
contain toxic substances
such as heavy
metals lead paint
and printer ink
they're generally made
in filthy warehouses
and garages in
asia eastern europe
and latin america
online buyers are

says matthew bassiur
vice president of
global security at
new york-based Pfizer the
factories are deplorable
i've seen photographs
of these places
he says you
wouldn't even want
to walk in
them let alone
ingest anything made
in them Pfizer
which invented the
term erectile dysfunction
has long been
aggressive in fighting
counterfeiters it conducts
undercover investigations and
works with authorities
around the globe
with good reason
Viagra and dozens
of other Pfizer
medicines rob the
company of billions
in annual sales
Viagra is one
of its top
drugs with $2 billion in
worldwide revenue last
year and it's the most
counterfeited drug in
company a 2011
study in which
Pfizer bought Viagra
from 22 popular
internet pharmacies and
tested the pills
found 77% were counterfeit most
had half or
less of the
promised level of
Viagra is appealing
to counterfeiters because
it carries a
double whammy: it's expensive and
it treats a
condition with an
embarrassment factor crooks
running the illegal
online pharmacies brazenly
explain their ultra-low Viagra prices
— often $1 to $3 a pill
— by claiming they
sell generic Viagra
generics are copycat
versions of brand-name prescription drugs
they can legally
be made after
a drugmaker's patent or
exclusive right to
sell a drug
ends generic drugmakers
spend $1 billion or
so on testing
to get a
new drug approved
so their copycat
versions often cost
up to 90% less than the
original drug but
such thing as
generic Viagra Pfizer
has patents giving
it the exclusive
right to sell
Viagra until 2020
in the u
s and for
many years in
other countries many
patients are unaware
of that dr
david dershewitz an
assistant urology professor
at new jersey
medical school who
treats patients at
newark's university hospital
says erectile dysfunction
is common in
men with enlarged
prostates diabetes and
other conditions but
most men are
too embarrassed to
discuss it he
says well over
half of his
patients who do
broach the issue
complain about Viagra's price some
tell dershewitz that
they go online
looking for bargains
because they can't afford Viagra
the few that
do admit to
it have said
that the results
have been fairly
dismal but none
has suffered serious
harm he says
for Pfizer that's a big
problem people who
buy fake drugs
online that don't work or
worse harm them
may blame the
company's product that's because
it's virtually impossible
to distinguish fakes
from real Viagra
the vast majority
of patients do
believe that they're getting Viagra
said vic cavelli
head of marketing
for primary care
medicines at Pfizer
which plans to
have drugstore chain
cvs caremark corp
fill the orders
placed on Viagra
com the sales
lost to counterfeits
threaten Pfizer at
a time when
Viagra's share of
the $5 billion-a-year global market
for legitimate erectile
dysfunction drugs has
slipped falling from
46 percent in
2007 to 39

further about 5
percent each year
for the next
five years unusual

well it will

interesting and novel
approach he says
whether it returns
Viagra to growth
say approved by
the FDA in
april 1998 Viagra
is the little
blue pill that
makes you larger
as alice would
say it is
the hottest-selling treatment on
erectile dysfunction which
affects an estimated
30 million american
men judging by
its swollen sales
— four pills are
sold every second
worldwide — it's the e-ticket into wonderland
not just for
the men taking
it either its
producer Pfizer inc
has earned in
excess of an
estimated $15 billion worldwide
to date since
its explosive arrival
on the ed
scene however more
than 500 deaths
have been reported
in association with
its use so
what does that
mean — and how safe
is Viagra? Viagra is very
safe — if prescribed in
accordance with the
instructions — to men with
ed who are
not taking nitrates
says dr ian
osterloh director of
the Viagra clinical
trials program at
Pfizer who has
overseen the drug
since the beginning
it has been
extensively studied in
thousands of patients
and there's no evidence
apart from patients
taking nitrates that
it's going to
cause any serious
problems but dr
sanjay kaul cardiologist
at cedars-sinai medical center
and associate professor
at ucla says
more research is
needed to definitively
prove Viagra's safety in
patients with existing
cardiac conditions the
pre-marketing clinical trials
that led to
Viagra's FDA approval
were conducted primarily
in patients at
low risk for
serious cardiovascular events
says kaul we
felt that those
trials did not
reflect the real-world practice and
there were many
anecdotal reports of
serious adverse events
- as well as
deaths - associated with the
use of Viagra
he adds so
driven by a
lack of clinical
trial data of
its safety in
patients at high
risk for cardiovascular
disease kaul and
his colleagues conducted
an analysis of
the adverse events
reported to the
FDA kaul presented
their findings before
the american college
of cardiologists annual
meeting last march
of 1 473
major adverse events
522 people died
mostly from cardiovascular
causes intriguingly the
majority of deaths
they found occurred
in patients who
were less than
65 years of
age and who
had no reported
cardiac risk factors
most importantly because
88% of the deaths
were reported in
individuals not on
nitrate therapy kaul
contends the study
suggests there may
be people at
increased risk because
of some susceptibility
to potential adverse
effects of Viagra
although Pfizer's literature clearly
states there is
a contraindication for
anyone taking nitrates
as for any
other susceptibility factor
osterloh says he
is not convinced
we know of
no plausible theory
apart from people
taking nitrates as
to why this
should be in
any case while
kaul is quick
to point out
that a cause-and-effect relationship has
not been established
he says their
data underscore the
need for more
research and controlled
clinical trials to
establish safety across
the whole spectrum
of patient population
the caveat emptor
- caveat lector - has never been
truer: buyer beware and
reader beware he
cautions additionally kaul
adds it is
very important to
interpret our data
within the context
of the limitations
of the fda's voluntary adverse
event reporting system
anybody - physician patient family
member friend - can file a
report but the
process is as
he puts it
cumbersome and not
user-friendly even the
FDA has conceded
that only 1-10% of the adverse
events get reported
with any drug
kaul says osterloh
agrees that underreporting
is a problem
regardless he says
the number of
adverse event reports
is not high
in relation to
prescriptions even allowing
for gross underreporting
because Viagra is
prescribed predominantly to
a middle-aged and an
elderly male population
with risk factors
for cardiac disease
there are bound
to be certain
men who by
chance are going
to have a
heart attack a
stroke or arrhythmia
osterloh notes the
only concern about
safety of the
drug that i'm aware of
stems from these
spontaneous reports all
of which get
databased nevertheless in
recent months researchers
around the world
have been conducting
studies to further
evaluate Viagra's safety many
of the latest
studies - most of which
have been funded
at least in
part by Pfizer
- have specifically been
focusing on cardiovascular
effects of the
drug since ed
is frequently a
marker for cardiovascular
of those studies
are emerging now
at university hospital
in lund sweden
in a double-blind placebo controlled
study of 224
men with cardiovascular
disease - including previous heart
attacks and coronary
artery disease - dr arne olsson
found that Viagra
was effective and
well tolerated researchers
at the university
of pennsylvania found
in a study
of 14 men
that Viagra had
no direct adverse
cardiovascular effects in
men with severe
according to dr
howard c hermann
professor of medicine
and lead author
which recently appeared
medicine in a
study designed to
simulate the physical
exertion of sexual
intercourse dr yoram
vardi and colleagues
put 32 men
with coronary heart
disease to a
treadmill stress test
at the rambam
medical center in
haifa israel they
found Viagra had
a limited effect
on blood pressure
and heart rate
yet was well
tolerated showing no
deleterious cardiovascular effects
in cardiac patients
according to vardi
at maastricht university
in the netherlands
dr john urquhart
professor of pharmacoepidemiology
analyzed the same
data as kaul
and colleagues at
cedars-sinai he found
that there were
32 times as
many deaths reported
with Viagra as
compared to muse
a locally applied
ointment the ratio
of deaths was
higher when compared
to yohimbine at
196 to 1
on heart tissue
published recently in
the journal urology
dr christian stief
at hannover medical
school in germany
found the presence
of pde5 which
might provide a
potential mechanism for
the cardiovascular side
effects that have
been reported with
Viagra at columbia
university dr stuart
d katz and
colleagues found that
Viagra may be
of benefit in
people with chronic
heart failure because
vasodilator and mitigates
the constriction of
blood vessels the
study of 48
patients with chronic
heart failure was
published in the
journal circulation at
massachusetts general hospital
dr john lepore's team found
of 22 patients
with pulmonary hypertension
that Viagra might
be beneficial to
increase blood flow
in those patients
when used in
conjunction with inhaled
nitric oxide another
well-known vasodilator the
study is currently
in press at
the journal of
heart failure point/counterpoint
meanwhile research
into the mechanisms
of potential Viagra-related adverse effects
is currently in
progress in several
labs including the
laboratory of kaul
and colleagues of
cedars-sinai one of
the concerns we
have with Viagra
is a potential
mechanism for inducing
heart arrhythmia and
that's what we're looking into
now kaul says
from all the
clinical and laboratory
work we've done i'm very confidant
that it doesn't induce arrhythmias
says osterloh at
the heart of
the issue is
the chicken-and-egg conundrum says
kaul does sexual
activity increase the
risk of an
adverse cardiovascular event
as is claimed
by Pfizer? or is the
Viagra itself the
cause of adverse
outcomes? Pfizer spokespeople and
company literature have
always noted that
sexual activity itself
may present a
cardiac risk for
some patients with
preexisting cardiovascular disease
meanwhile the princeton
consensus panel a
worldwide group of
medical experts has
issued new guidelines
for physicians on
the management of
sexual dysfunction in
patients with cardiovascular
disease those guidelines
current issue of
the american journal
of cardiology essentially
reflect the recommendations
made in january
1999 by the
american college of
cardiology and the
american heart association
the upshot says
kaul who was
on the committee
writing the recommendations
is that for
many patients at
low risk Viagra
is a well-tolerated and helpful
medication but we
really don't have the
data in patients
at high risk
therefore we should
exercise prudence and
caution in patients
Viagra is an
effective drug that
treats a very
distressing condition reiterates
osterloh it is
however a prescription
drug and consumers
should be advised
their doctor and
listen to them
he adds everybody
has some responsibility
here until all
the data is
reported and investigated
the situation will
remain one of
point/counterpoint i don't want to
be alarmist stresses
kaul i just
believe the company
and the fda
should do more
to study if
there is any
real risk in
these susceptible patients
osterloh counters: we've studied and
looked at all
sorts of issues
that have been
raised we've had a
huge program from
general studies where
large numbers of
patients were recruited
to small studies
targeting specific populations
they have replicated
the findings of
the original clinical
studies the false
impression of the
safety profile of
this drug is
what's so frustrating
when we know
how good the
data is i
have no beef
against Viagra replies
kaul but we
need to do
more to unravel
the potential for
harmful effects until
we truly delineate
Viagra in patients
we should temper
the claims of
it being a
magic bullet with
the notion that
in some people
it may be
more bullet than
magic the majority
of the cases
were in new
york florida and
texas medicaid the
health insurance program
for the poor
is administered differently
in every state
thus while some
states allowed medicaid
payments for prescriptions
for the drugs
Viagra Cialis and
levitra other states
did not new
york acting on
a tip was
the first to
uncover that medicaid
had paid for
Viagra prescriptions for
sex offenders its
report prompted the
federal government which
provides states with
funds for medicaid
to order states
to take steps
to stop the
coverage for these
felons the states
that provided registered
sex offenders with
subsidized impotence drugs
are florida 218

at least $3 085 gov
mark r warner
issued an emergency
order barring medicaid
from continuing to
pay for the
drugs for these
men kyle smith
a spokesman for
the kansas bureau
of investigation put
it this way: do we have
programs giving clubs
to wife beaters
or drinks for
those committing dui? weird things happen
in this world
and this is
weirder in alabama
officials said the
federal government previously
had mandated that
states pay for
now that we
are armed with
new information from
the federal government
alabama can and
will deny this
coverage for registered
sex offenders carol
herrmann the state's medicaid director
said last week
some states had
relied on a
1998 letter from
the clinton administration
as a basis
for providing coverage
said matt salo
a staff member
governors association but
that letter also
said restrictions could
be put in
place to curb
abuse for example
the letter said
states should limit
refills or the
quantity of pills
per prescription that
letter sent to
then-govs mike leavitt
of utah and
lawton chiles of
florida said medicaid
must cover all
fda-approved drugs with
certain exceptions those
exceptions included drugs
used for weight
control for cosmetic
purposes or to
promote fertility the
law is pretty
clear the letter
in 1998 said
medicaid had to
cover Viagra said
salo the director
of the association's health and
human services committee
i don't think there
is any dispute
about that some
states did decline
to provide coverage
for impotence drugs
to any male
south dakota considers
Viagra and similar
drugs to be
fertility drugs our
rules are specific
in that we
do not cover
agents to promote
fertility or to
treat impotence said
larry iverson director
of south dakota's office of
medical services wisconsin
officials simply ignored
the directive the
state's health and
human services chief
thought the directive
was ill-advised and chose
to disregard it
said a department
spokeswoman stephanie marquis
tennessee took the
position that the
treatment of erectile
dysfunction is not
medically necessary the
state has approved
coverage of Viagra
in five cases
not involving sex
offenders for treatment
of pulmonary hypertension
gary karr a
centers for Medicare
and medicaid services
said states always
have had the
right to determine
what treatments are
medically necessary obviously
there was some
degree of confusion
or misunderstanding from
the letter the
clinton administration sent
out he said
many states are
reviewing whether the
dysfunction is a
medical necessity i
give Viagra to
sex offenders that's pretty ridiculous
said robbie kerr
director of south
carolina's health and
human services department
the point to
me is not
that we're paying for
Viagra and sex
offenders may somehow
get it the
point is why
am i covering
Viagra at all? the federal government
told states this
past week that
they had to
take steps to
ensure such drugs
did not go
to sex offenders
but the fallout
could be much
broader because congress
has proposed banning
coverage of impotence
drugs for all
medicaid and Medicare
recipients sen charles
grassley r-iowa said such
a restriction would
save $2 billion over
the next decade
some doctors disagree
with that approach
they say drugs
that allow older
people or the
ill to maintain
a sex life
encourages them to
lead a healthier
lifestyle states that
have imposed a
ban on coverage
are effectively lumping
thousands of victims
of crippling disease
in with criminals

is the female
Viagra finally making
its way to
the market? an advisory committee
voted 18-6 last week
to recommend Flibanserin
for approval but
thispink pillis not
at all like
the famousblue pillViagra
which works by
increasing blood flow
to the sex
organs Flibanserin which
will be marketed
under the name
addyi works directly
on the chemicals
of the brain
increasing dopamine and
norepinephrine the fda
has twice rejected
the drug since
2010 amid protests
from critics that
women's drugs don't receive the
same attention as
men's but Flibanserin
does have significant
side effects some
doctors are concerned
about the risk
of dizziness low
pressure and even
blackouts especially when
and for women
taking birth control
pills one member
of the advisory
panel kathryn curtis
expressed her concerns
in an interview
saying … it seems there
are a lot
of situations in
addition to alcohol
that are going
to increase the
drug and possibly
lead to adverse
effects but women's groups have
long been on
the lookout for
a survey of
women with low
libido revealed one
additional sexually satisfying
experience a month
for those taking
Flibanserin supporters of
the drug myself
included feel that
even this modest
effect make the
drug worth trying
and potential side
effects can be
carefully monitored by
physicians in other
words give me
the option to
prescribe this drug
and let me
and my patients
decide when and
appropriate to do
so another member
of the fda
panel dr walid
gellad assistant professor
of medicine at
pittsburgh was supportive
of Flibanserin for
just these reasons
he said there
are many women
that suffer and
there are many
women for whom
the drug will
work and there
for whom the
drug will not
work the benefits
are modest … maybe less than
modest but i
think that puts
it in good
company with other
approved drugs sprout
pharmaceuticals led by
women has made
its purpose the
pursuit of this
much needed scientific
and societal breakthrough
for women there
has never been
a drug before
to directly target
libido Flibanserin is
the first and
its long term
side effects are
not yet known
on the other
hand there are
already many drugs
which target the
chemicals of the
brain and increase
these same brain
hormones the fda
generally accepts the
recommendations of its
panels so you
can expect this
drug to be
approved since as
everyone knows the
brain is the
number one sex
organ it is
high time for
this pioneer drug
to appear on
the shelves and
in the medicine
cabinet Canadian drug
maker valeant pharmaceuticals
thursday will pay

in october the
medication will give
women the first-ever drug approved
treatment for absence

valeant chairman and
ceo j michael
pearson said in

the deal announcement
deal would provide
the capacity to
ensure more affordable
access to women
who have been
waiting for an
fda-approved medication to
treat absence or
sharp diminishing of
sexual desire beyond
building this in
valeant also offers
us a global
footprint that could
eventually bring addyi
to women across
the globe she
said sprout's road to
financial success hasn't come without
bumps it took
multiple tries to
win FDA approval
for its breakthrough
drug the earlier
turn-downs over side
effects and questions
of effectiveness prompted
and other opponents
to urge further
study toward a
safer libido-booster for women
those groups in
turn faced opposition
from Flibanserin backers
including a sprout-backed group the
supporters questioned whether
the fda's previous rejections
resulted from gender
bias sprout raised
money from dozens
of investors well
before the approval
the company issued
five exempt offerings
of securities between
march 2012 and
june 2015 securities
and exchange commission
filings show each
offering which did
not list the

of the offerings
the records show
the proceeds were
to be used

are paying $25 to $30 a pill
on the black
market the biggest
problem with Viagra
is that it
is being abused
by young people
says new york
psychologist and sex
therapist judy kuriansky
they are getting
it off the
net buying it
in parks and
on school campuses
they think they
will be really
macho and have
erections that last
forever even junior
high school students
have the misconception
that Viagra is
an aphrodisiac a
party drug says
coral gables fla
sexologist marilyn volker
any kind of
drug can find
all sorts of
teens or young
people healthy young
college students won't benefit from
Viagra although they
may experience some
kind of placebo
effect that makes
them believe the
little blue diamond
is a magic
pill kuriansky says
young men have
good erections anyway
it's like pouring
more water into
a glass already
full of water
says annette owens
a sex therapist
in charlottesville va
and member of
the american council
of sex educators
counselors and therapists
a much bigger
worry is the
on the club
and rave scenes
at parties favored
by the young
Viagra is being
combined with illegal
drugs including cocaine
amphetamines and the
designer drug ecstasy
experts say one
british study found
that Viagra was
being used as
a recreational drug
in british nightclubs
within weeks of
its introduction there
in september 1998
a study reported
last summer in
the Canadian medical
association journal reported
on health risks
at raves including
using Viagra with
ecstasy the biggest
danger is combining
poppers or amyl
nitrate and Viagra
experts say both
drugs dilate blood
vessels which can
result in a
sudden drop in
cause a heart
Viagra and nitrates
are never to
be used together
volker says people
have died from
doing that numerous
deaths have been
reported from the
use of poppers
plus Viagra says
marshall forstein medical
mental health and
addiction services at
fenway community health
center in boston
excellent drug when
it is used
appropriately he says
combined with other
drugs it can
be deadly forstein
cautions that drugs
bought on the
black market are
often impure people
use these drugs
without realizing some
come with additives
Viagra bought over
the internet or
brought in from
overseas these products
are not reputable
ecstasy is know
as a hug
pill it increases
desire but it
also decreases sexual
performance users may
be trying to
overcome the ecstasy
with Viagra says
wilkie wilson professor
of pharmacology at
duke university medical
center and co-author of buzzed:
the straight facts
about the most
used and abused
drugs from alcohol
to ecstasy the
drug has been
linked to seizures
and death wilson
does not pinpoint
additional dangers from
combining ecstasy and
Viagra but says
real data on
how they interact
at the metabolic
level and he
cautions there is
always a potential
problem when you
mix drugs volker
describes a syndrome: students often combine
these drugs with
alcohol which turns
up the sex
center but too
much alcohol becomes
a depressant then
they use speed
or ecstasy to
keep the party
going and possibly
then Viagra the
body can't maintain all
this and it
crashes james peloquen
a psychiatrist at
long island college
hospital in brooklyn
believes there is
an increase in
young Viagra abusers
peloquen has been
told by young
men that Viagra
cocktails have enabled
them to have
sex for four
or five hours
with four or
five orgasms he
believes them young
men can do
such things one
of the troubling
effects of these
drugs is how
they influence the
behavior of the
young people do
stupid things when
they get high
peloquen says you
end up with
unwanted pregnancies sexually
transmitted diseases such
as hepatitis b
and hiv judgment
is impaired and
you go home
with somebody you
should not if
youve watched a
sporting event in
the last i
dunno 15 years
you may have
noticed the near-constant cavalcade of
ads for erectile-dysfunction drugs like
Viagra and Cialis
to some theyre
a little unsettling
— especially the recent
campaigns that feature
attractive women speaking
seductively into the
camera to others
theyre silly: i defy you
not to giggle
a little at
the four or
more hours part
of the disclaimer
even if you
know from the
same disclaimer that
serious medical condition
requiring immediate medical
attention but to
certain parents of
curious children the
commercials can lead
to awkward and
uncomfortable moments in
the midst of
watching sports — purportedly a family
affair and so
cardinals pitcher adam
wainwright took to
twitter to call
out major league
baseball and fox
for the ubiquitous
ads: wainwright has earned
more than $75 million in
his major league
career and hes
made a lot
of that money
thanks to the
target audiences for
those ads watching
him pitch between
trips to the
emergency room to
address priapism which
again is a
real and serious
medical condition that
you should definitely
not google and
which they only
know about thanks
to the public
service announcements being
read by an
attractive woman in
laying on a
bed and shooting
sultry looks at
the camera an
increasing number of
american youths who
use the club
drug ecstasy are
mixing it with
the anti-impotency drug Viagra
leading drug-abuse speCialists to
warn about the
health risks of
a combination that
users say fuels
all-night dancing and
marathon sex the
combined drugs — known in the
club scene as
sextasy — began as a
fad among youths
in england and
australia about a
year ago officials
of the u
s drug enforcement
administration began hearing
reports that the
mixture had become
popular in this
country's gay party
culture now drug-abuse analysts say
anecdotal reports from
across the USA
indicate that sextasy
has become one
the most recent
products of a
dangerous trend: young clubgoers taking
cocktail pills that
can include as
many as a
half-dozen drugs ecstasy
mdma is a
stimulant with hallucinogenic
properties a u
s government study
in 2001 indicated
that about 12% of high school
seniors had tried
it that was
well less than
the usage rate
for marijuana but
it represented a
huge jump from
1998 users in
the club and
rave scenes say
it gives them
the energy to
dance all night
and enhances their
senses but ecstasy
also hinders sexual
function to compensate
some young men
take Viagra a
prescription drug normally
decreased sexual function
or who are
recovering from prostate
cancer doctors warn
that combining the
two drugs can
cause heart problems
or erections that
don't subside for
hours possibly leading
to anatomical damage
there have been
scattered reports of
such injuries across
the country officials
say in internet
chat rooms that
cater to those
in the club
scene talk of
multiple-drug combinations —
particularly ecstasy and
Viagra — is becoming more
common this month
the royal Canadian
mounted police warned
about combination drugs
anti-drug police units
in canada analyzed
about 1 200
pills seized at
clubs and raves
and found that
fewer than one-fifth contained one
illicit drug — in this case
ecstasy it's not uncommon
to see a
capsule tablet or
powder with six
different drugs cpl
scott rintoul of
the rcmp says
the most prevalent
combination has been
ecstasy methamphetamine the
anesthetic ketamine and
caffeine there's a consumer
population who wants
meth with ecstasy
and other drugs
rintoul says now
the drug dealers
are responding to
consumer demands for
Viagra drug-abuse speCialists who
work in Washington
state say youths
there have told
them about the
popularity of sextasy
pills they are
stealing from their
next-door neighbors says
ellen silverman a
policy speCialist at
Washington state's department of
social and health
services taking Viagra
within four hours
of taking an
alpha-blocker a group
of drugs used
enlarged prostates could
cause fainting according
to a new
precaution listed on
the impotence pill's label Viagra
itself lowers blood
pressure since it
came on the
market 4 and
a half years
ago its label
has warned that
men on any
nitrate drug such
as nitroglycerin should
never take Viagra
because their blood
pressure could drop
dangerously low while
drug administration has
received reports of
fainting after Viagra
use the agency
couldn't be sure
whether those cases
resulted from the
impotence drug says
dan shames who
oversees the fda
office that regulates
Viagra even without
taking Viagra shames
notes older men
faint once in
awhile because of
what was known
about how alpha-blockers work the
FDA asked Pfizer
Viagra's maker to
study its interaction
with that class
of drugs shames
says Pfizer studied
how a 4-milligram dose of
its own alpha-blocker cardura or
doxazosin interacts with
Viagra in men
with benign prostatic
hyperplasia but shames
emphasizes that the
findings apply to
all alpha-blockers even the
smallest dose of
Viagra 25 milligrams
caused a further
lowering of blood
pressure in men
on cardura according
to the new
label information but
it was only
the 50-milligram and 100-milligram doses that
caused some men
to faint because
their pressure dropped
so low fainting
occurred only in
men who took
the two drugs
of each other
for that says
mark blumenthal executive
american botanical council
in austin enzyte
can probably thank
Viagra since Viagra
the first pill
to treat impotence
market in 1998
he says we're getting used
to the idea
of marketing products
for improving male
performance but do
they work? while some of
these herbs have
been used for
centuries clinical trials
are lacking in
such scientific studies
men would be
receive either a
placebo or the
herb in question
the folks who
market enzyte offer
up their independent
customer study which
involved mailing a
questionnaire with the
product to 70
men according to
a company brochure
the most-improved volunteers reported
that the length
and circumference of
their erect penis
increased a total
of four inches
it makes no
sense medically counters
dallas urologist kenneth
goldberg there's no way
that increasing blood
penis as enzyte
claims to do
will actually increase
its size he
says unfortunately guys
are just preoccupied
with the thought
that their penises
are small goldberg
says they have
all kinds of
psychological issues over
it it's very easy
to play on
that weakness apparently
so enzyte has
been so successful
that two more
smiling bob commercials
are set to
air later this
year says steve
warshak founder of
lifekey a cincinnati
company that sells
the product a
typical enzyte customer
warshak says is
between 30 and
55 years old
probably a little
higher income you
know your golfers
and your bimmer
drivers that's not surprising
considering that a
month's supply — 60 capsules — costs $99 95 in
the past two
months warshak says
21 400 men
were repeat customers
ordering online or
by calling lifekey
now about that
supposedly latin phrase
in the product's logo: suffragium asotas warshak
translated the phrase
as enhanced sexuality
Viagra has changed
the american sexual
landscape forever since
it was approved
for use by
drug administration three
years ago on
march 27 1998
the blue pill
shaped like a
diamond has saved
countless marriages by
giving men back
their sexual prowess
and their self-esteem but as
the prescription drug
energizes tens of
thousands of couples
it also destabilizes
others some sex
therapists and divorce
attorneys say husbands
previously unable to
perform confront Viagra
wives not excited
to be asked
once again for
sex some of
my friends in
my age bracket
complain that while
their libido is
undergoing a natural
decline their husbandsinterest
in sex has
rebounded due to
Viagra says rosalind
brannigan 58 of
arlington va it
creates a disparity
of intentions and
expectations they are
on different tracks
some Viagra wives
now have to
confront their own
sexual dysfunction sex
experts say their
husbands feel free
to pack blue
diamonds when they
go on business
trips erectile dysfunction
— the inability to
get and maintain
an erection firm
enough to have
sex — no longer haunts
them as it
does 30 million
american men and
as Viagra goes
mainstream used by
ever-younger men seeking
self-confidence or bigger
erections rather than
relief from strictly
medical conditions the
results are showing
up in divorce
courts across the
country this drug
has moved out
into the popular
culture says leonore
tiefer a manhattan
clinical psychologist specializing
in sex therapy
for 30 years
we don't have any
idea what is
really happening with
it it is
being sold in
clubs and on
the internet all
kinds of people
are taking it
who would not
qualify under the
strict medical definition
nobody claims Viagra
causes affairs or
divorce but increasingly
factor in both
says dominic barbara
who heads a
manhattan law firm
with 15 attorneys
in about one
of every 15
or 20 new
divorce cases somebody
mentions Viagra he
says initially the
Viagra divorce cases
were the result
of men straying
from marriage popping
a pill seen
as the fountain
of youth he
says then came
cases of men
taking Viagra but
their wives were
no longer interested
in sex and
now a lot
of middle-aged women are
having affairs with
older men who
were impotent before
there was Viagra
he recalls a
woman who brought
him a bottle
of pills to
identify the husband
had tried to
hide his Viagra
in his vitamins
these blue pills
are very distinctive
i recognized them
right away barbara
says the firm
hired a private
investigator who quickly
confirmed an affair
barbara handled a
landmark case of
a 61-year-old woman who
said her 70-year-old partner was
on the prowl
and had a
girlfriend within two
days after starting
Viagra they ought
to put a
warning label on
that bottle barbara
says the couple
eventually reconciled manhattan
divorce attorney raoul
felder recalls a
husband enthusiastic about
Viagra who tried
to give it
to his wife
in a beverage
without her knowing
she came to
felder to discuss
a lawsuit affairs
made possible by
Viagra are inevitable
felder says it
enables men who
have enough money
and time on
their hands to
enjoy the time
on their hands
dallas divorce attorney
kenneth raggio recalls
an affair uncovered
when a man
took eight Viagra
pills which his
wife had counted
out of town
and came back
with one she
confronted her husband
and he admitted
an affair he
also claimed he
gave her some
but never told
her about it
women who are
wishy-washy about divorce
are galvanized when
Viagra enters the
picture raggio says
when the wives
know they are
not having Viagra-induced sex with
their husbands but
someone else is
it really makes
them take the
next step toward
divorce Viagra is
becoming as effective
a tool in
confirming an affair
as finding him
in a hotel
room with his
honey charles shainberg
a philadelphia attorney
and president of
the american academy
of matrimonial lawyers
says Viagra can
be the last
straw in deciding
if a divorce
goes forward we
also see a
larger number of
divorces among long-term couples and
we suspect Viagra
may be one
reason it changes
a man's ego new
york-based psychologist and
sex therapist judy
kuriansky is a
fan of Viagra
and says it
is linked to
many more success
stories than divorces
but she also
says some of
the same groups
vulnerable to affairs
in general are
made more so
by Viagra: men having midlife
crises the 40-year-old man is
now insecure about
his sexuality he
looks for a
fast car a
younger woman and
the hard erection
he had when
he was 18
kuriansky says couples
facing the empty-nest syndrome the
kids have gone
off to college
and the husband
and wife are
faced with being
just with each
other wives going
through menopause the
wife is maybe
withdrawing from an
interest in sex
as she readjusts
to physical and
mood changes she
may not be
prepared for his
new ability to
have sex many
couples are simply
ignorant about how
the pill works
and are never
told by a
doctor about the
need for good
communication sex therapists
say the pill
is not an
aphrodisiac it takes
about 30 minutes
to an hour
to work restoring
the penis that
is necessary to
have an erection
the pill does
not work in
the absence of
sexual desire it
does not restore
libido and it
requires a partner's active participation
it only works
of sexual arousal
with another person
says domeena renshaw
psychiatrist and director
of the loyola
university sexual dysfunction
clinic in maywood
ill the partner
needs to provide
stimulation that is
both tactile and
visual it also
won't help women
who would like
to give their
men a surreptitious
sexual boost renshaw
knows women who
slip Viagra into
their husband's hot chocolate
way that will
be effective for
some troubled couples
with relationship difficulties
the most effective
treatment may be
a combination of
counseling plus at
least the temporary
linda banner has
statistics she works
with the university
of california san francisco
stanford sexual health
and medicine program
and the american
association of sex
educators counselors and
therapists banner was
able to help
65% of 60 couples
combining the two
therapies to the
point the men
no longer needed
to rely on
Viagra the Viagra
became a bridge
not a crutch
she says the
focus needs to
be on communication
not penetration experts
say so much
of sex is
a dance of
intimacy says robert
kolodny of behavioral
medicine institute in
new canaan conn
and author of
heterosexuality it is
about exchanges of
tenderness and love
and body language
alfred and cheryl
pariser of rancho
mirage calif know
all about tenderness
and sex and
they call Viagra
a miracle drug
he was unable
to have an
erection after prostate
cancer surgery now
61 and on
Viagra he says
he has sex
as often as
my wife wants
and he asks
friends do you
as good as
when you were
30? and they say
of course not
and i say
well i do
thank you god
for Viagra says
cheryl 56 initially
Viagra was touted
for those with
dramatic medical problems
like pariser's and focused
on older men
but increasingly many
experts say it
is being given
to a much
broader and younger
group of men
some are experimenting
people are looking
for enhancement vs
treatment for an
underlying sexual function
says mitchell tepper
educator and founder
of www sexualhealth
com they want
a little extra
a little harder
something lasting a
little longer we
have a performance-oriented society some
younger men are
looking for a
confidence booster to
combat performance anxiety
or negotiate a
life transition such
as a divorce
michael perelman recalls
one 44-year-old who was
told by his
ex-wife during a
divorce that he
was terrible in
bed i used
Viagra to jump-start his confidence
with a new
girlfriend says perelman
co-director of the
human sexuality program
at new york
presbyterian hospital weill
cornell medical center
the patient was
weaned from the
drug after a
few sessions as
the therapy began
to concentrate on
his dating issues
ian osterloh is
a physician with
Pfizer which makes
Viagra — now a $2 billion seller
for the company
according to healthcare
information company ims
health he helped
design clinical trials
for the drug
a patient with
psychological problems has
still got ed
the treatment works
very well with
most of those
groups they receive
a boost in
confidence today's younger men
will provide a
huge market for
the pipeline many
experts say there
is no doubt
it is positive
in terms of
social relationships between
says myron murdock
of the impotence
institute of america
he has been
a consultant for
Viagra and is
a major supporter
of it the
younger males who
are taking care
of the kids
and changing diapers
are much more
open to discussing
health problems they
won't tolerate having
sexual difficulties they
already know there
is a way
to treat it
the maker of
Cialis wants its
pill sold to
men without a
prescription under a
licensing deal between
co and french
drugmaker sanofi Cialis
could become the
for male impotence
to be sold
the plan still
needs approval from
regulators who would
weigh the risks
of allowing the
sold without a
doctor's visit the
two companies hope
for a 2018
launch of what
they're calling Cialis
otc that's the same
year patents for
Cialis are expected
to expire in
and europe allowing
cheaper generics to
take over and
effectively dry up
lilly's considerable profits
from the drug
Cialis generated $2 16 billion
in sales last
year and was
lilly's fourth best-selling drug a
plan to sell
Cialis over the
counter would allow
the Indianapolis drugmaker
profit from the
drug as an
impotence treatment lilly
didn't reveal financial
details of the
deal with sanofi
sanofi will be
responsible for commercializing
nonprescription Cialis wherever
it receives approval
while lilly will
manufacture Cialis for
sanofi the drug
sold in tablet
form is made
by lilly in
puerto rico Cialis
has been prescribed
to more than
since its launch
in europe in
2002 and in
a year later
the drug has
been widely used
and proven to
be safe and
effective so it's a good
candidate to sell
said dave ricks
a senior vice
president at lilly
in addition over-the-counter sales would
be a safer
option for men
than buying illicit
forms of Cialis
online without a
prescription ricks said
he said many
of the Cialis
tablets advertised online
are fake or
adulterated a large
unmet demand exists
for over-the-counter Cialis because
many men suffering
from impotence don't feel comfortable
talking to a
problem ricks said
half of men
over 40 suffer
ed ricks said
but the current
market only represents
a fraction men
go through the
hassle and sometimes
discussions with doctors
there is a
need to self-diagnose we think
that availability is
key to helping
guys with impotence
the first prescription
to market was
Pfizer's Viagra introduced
in the late
1990s Pfizer applied
in europe several
years ago to
sell Viagra over
the counter but
later withdrew its
request will take
the lead in
pursuing regulatory approval
one concern for
regulators will be
that Cialis isn't supposed to
medicines called nitrates
often prescribed for
chest pain the
a dangerous drop
regulators also might
be concerned that
impotence is sometimes
a sign of
other medical problems
which won't be discovered
if men are
allowed to buy
Cialis without a
checkup potentially regulators
could approve over-the-counter sales of
Cialis only at
certain doses and
for some indications
ricks said lilly
said it struck
sanofi to take
Cialis otc because
sanofi has experience
in conducting consumer
studies and gaining
approval for over-the-counter formulations of
other brand drugs
including allergy medications
nasacort and allegra
the two companies
hope for a
2018 launch of
what they're calling Cialis
it generated $2 16 billion
lilly's fourth-best-selling drug Cialis
normally used to
in men may
offer promise for
boys with a
fatal muscle disorder
in a preliminary
study published today
in the journal
neurology the drug
appears to improve
the boysmuscles just
as it boosts
the penis of
dysfunction the drug
was given to
10 boys over
a short period
so the results
are far from
conclusive they do
indicate that Cialis
deserves more research
for the boysdisease
known as duchenne
muscular dystrophy we
had really striking
results said ronald
victor a cardiologist
in los angeles
who led the
work examining the
boysmuscle cells after
treatment he said
it looked like
a complete correction
flow abnormality in
duchenne muscular dystrophy
boys who are
apparently normal until
age 4-8 suddenly start
to go weak
in their 20s
or sometimes earlier
their heart or
diaphragm – both muscles – give out and
they die the
genetic glitch that
causes the disease
robs the body
of its ability
to produce a
muscle protein called
dystrophin which provides
structure to muscles
and helps send
cellular signals without
dystrophin muscle cells
are unable to
repair the damage
caused by exercise
the disease is
nearly exclusive to
boys because the
gene that makes
the protein occurs
twice in girls
but only once
in boys so
damage to one
copy will cause
the disease curing
the duchenne probably
will take a
multi-pronged approach treatment
with Cialis could
prove effective enough
to become part
of that approach
said pat furlong
founding president and
ceo of parent
project muscular dystrophy
an advocacy group
Cialis almost certainly
won't change the
course of the
disease but she
said if it
provides more nutrition
to muscles through
the blood supply
if it provides
more energy to
the children and
more endurance on
those skeletal muscles
then that contributes
to the whole
of what we're trying to
accomplish for these
kids drugs are
under development to
support muscle and
boost the production
of dystrophin blood
pressure drugs and
the cancer drug
tamoxifen are being
explored to see
if they offer
benefits to duchenne
patients furlong said
Cialis did lead
to some side
effects the new
study showed several
of the boys
had prolonged erections
while taking the
drug – one for six
hours – though victor said
they were not
reported to be
painful a lower
dose of the
drug comparable to
what men take
appeared to normalize
the boysskeletal muscles
a higher dose
used for some
breathing problems enabled
the boysmuscles to
recover after exercise
victor said researchers
also tested the
Viagra but found
it had to
be taken more
often than Cialis
– as much as
three times a
day – and couldn't be taken
with food victor
has begun testing
Cialis in a
larger longer-term study funded
by the drug's manufacturer eli
lilly to see
whether it will
provide noticeable benefits
to those with
duchenne the European
union has approved
cos erectile dysfunction
drug Cialis to
treat symptoms tied
to an enlarged
prostate lilly based
in Indianapolis said
tuesday the commission
approved a 5-milligram once-daily dose to
treat the signs
and symptoms of
the condition also
known as benign
prostatic hyperplasia those
symptoms include the
need to urinate
frequently or urgently
and the need
to go excessively
at night lilly
said many men
who have erectile
dysfunction also experience
the symptoms of
an enlarged prostate
last month the
European union's committee for
medicinal products for
human use recommended
the approval of
Cialis for the
expanded use the
u s food
approved the expanded
use last fall
Cialis brought in
$1 88 billion
last year or
8% of lilly's total revenue
as its fifth-best-selling product it
recorded $1 41 billion

the first three
quarters of 2012

the week before
the super bowl
ads ran levitra
had 25% Cialis 23% and Viagra 52
when a group
of 100 urologists
was broken out
from the larger
sampling of primary
care physicians the
results favored Cialis
even more dramatically
— 50% to 29% for levitra and
18% for Viagra total
requests for the
drugs were up
more than 40% from the previous
week impactrx said
that's good news
for all three
in a market
with huge room
for expansion as
an estimated 85% of ed sufferers
have yet to
seek any treatment
the levitra ad
featured former football
coach and hall
of fame player
mike ditka poking
fun at baseball
for being a
less macho sport
— an insider's reference to
the summer game
often sponsored by
the type of
direct-to-consumer ad that
does not mention
what the drug
treats instead telling
viewers to ask
their doctors glaxo
representatives said they
did not feel
it appropriate to
before a massive
family audience — an opinion clearly
not shared by
the mtv-produced bump and
grind half-time show that
culminated with jackson's
much-discussed exposed right
breast the Cialis
folks decided not
to shy away
from the delicate
subject seizing on
the opportunity to
reach an enormous
audience to drive
home what sets
their drug apart
from its rivals
— effectiveness for up
to 36 hours
the other two
work for about
four to five
hours various scenes
of couples in
tender moments were
accompanied by a
voice over that
provided the selling
points as well
as the obligatory
side effect profile
that likely provided
some uncomfortable moments
in the family
room i do
think that the
Cialis ad was
probably more effective
because the 36
hours kept appearing
said barbara lippert
critic for adweek
magazine although having
to say aloud
in case of
a four-hour erection you
should seek medical
attention was the
capper for tastelessness
given that children
were watching she
said the levitra
ad might even
backfire what about
all the men
who would need
levitra who like
baseball? lippert asked are
they alienating something
like 40% of their audience?
last year's world sales
for the medications
were about $2 7 billion
suntrust robinson humphrey
estimates — at least $1 billion lower
than drug industry
analysts forecast two
years ago Pfizer's Viagra pioneered
the market in
1998 at the
time one wall
street firm reportedly
expected that drug
alone to post
sales of $4 5 billion
by now instead
its 2004 sales
were $1 7 billion
down 11% from 2003 newcomers
likewise have failed
to spark heavy
desire Cialis and
levitra entered the
u s market
in late 2003
giving Viagra its
first real competition
they expanded the
market but not
as much as
they had hoped
deutsche bank's pharmaceutical analyst
barbara ryan says
not even Medicare's coverage of
the pills expected
jan 1 will
be much of
a boon ryan
says while more
consumers may get
the pills Medicare
is likely to
negotiate price discounts
that will offset
some of those
increased sales what's more Medicare
covers only those
over 65 and
some younger disabled
consumers only 22% of Viagra prescriptions
go to men
60 to 69
Pfizer says and
9% to those 70
and older there
could be some
benefit ryan says
it won't be all
that substantial despite
disappointments the market
is growing u
s sales rose
10% last year through
november says market
research firm ims
health that growth
may have had
a heavy cost
however u s
consumer advertising for
Cialis jointly marketed
and biotech firm
icos reached $165 million in
the first 11
months of last
year says nielsen
monitor-plus that's $1 million more
than the drug's u s
sales for the
same period says
ims health it's $55 million more
than consumer advertising
for lipitor the
world's best-selling drug whose
2004 sales were
$11 billion all
told u s
ad spending for
Cialis levitra and
Viagra topped $406 million for
months up from
$136 million for
the same period
a year ago
nielsen says spending
for coca-cola was just
$22 million higher
nielsen says with
all that it
is a bit
disappointing that it
hasn't taken off
as some expected
Pfizer spokesman daniel
watts says but
icos sees the
situation differently it
points to Cialisno
2 market share
prescriptions as evidence
that big ad
spending has worked
it's also common
for ad spending
to outpace sales
in a launch
year icosvice president
for marketing leonard
blum says he
also says nielsen's numbers are
high because they
don't account for
discounts icos wouldn't release figures
but it's not shying
from big buys
Cialis ads will
run during sunday's super bowl
telecast their second
consecutive appearance thirty-second spots sell
for an average
$2 4 million
a record the
market is growing
fast enough for
Cialis to succeed
blum says our
competitors are not
seeing the demand
that they had
projected too many
freebies? free samples are
one big factor
dampening growth drug
companies say drug
companies frequently give
samples to doctors
for patients in
hopes of attracting
long-term users the
freebies expanded after
entered the market
says fred nelson
at market researcher
impactrx which tracks
doctor prescribing patterns
in april 2003
before Cialis and
levitra 22% of patients got
free samples but
no prescriptions that
rose to between
29% and 40% of patients in
december impactrx says
there's a lot
of free product
out there and
that's a challenge
says michael fleming
glaxosmithkline which co-markets levitra with
schering-plough in the
USA we believe
that will increasingly
translate into sales
but doctors point
to perhaps more
vexing reasons for
disappointing sales a
lot of it
is interest says
john mulcahy co-chairman of the
sexual function health
council of the
american foundation for
urologic disease we've talked a
lot about this
how do we
light a fire
under these guys? he quotes studies
showing that 30
suffer from erectile
dysfunction but only
10% to 15% are being treated
many older men
may still be
ask about treatment
he adds or
don't think it's worth it
especially if their
insurance won't cover the
cost without insurance
the cost is
about $9 to $10 a pill
for the three
market leaders for
many others the
pills don't work or
taken with other
drugs they're on says
timothy tsang chief
of urology at
kaiser permanente in
san jose calif
he says the
drugs work for
about one out
of two patients
mulcahy sees a
success rate of
two out of
three tsang is
skeptical that big
advertising spending will
draw that many
more men to
the products people
who want to
seek care have
already tried he
says the message
is out in
terms of getting
men in to
see their doctors
Viagra holds lead
while the newcomers
have cut into
Viagra's sales its
market share for
new prescriptions is
still above 63% says verispan a
research firm that
tracks sales at
55% of u s
pharmacies while the
three drugs are
similar Cialis is
vs about four
to six hours
for Viagra and
up to 12
for levitra robert
hazlett analyst at
and one of
the most optimistic
about the market
expects overall u
s sales to
rise 13% this year helped
by new prescriptions
and price increases
while overall growth
little bit of
a disappointment he
says it's growing in
the right direction
drug administration still
is investigating but
has no evidence
yet that the

blame said spokeswoman
susan cruzan this
type of blindness
is called naion
or non-arteritic anterior ischemic
optic neuropathy it
can occur in
men who are
diabetic or have
heart disease the
same conditions that
can cause impotence

to Viagra use
42 reports of

among users of
Viagra and four

take this seriously
said fda's cruzan the

Pfizer inc also
refers on its

some vision issues: less common are
bluish or blurred

sensitive to light
these may occur
for a short
time that language

daniel watts confirmed
friday that the
drugmaker was in
discussions with the
FDA about adding
a disclosure to
Viagra's label to
say that in
rare cases men
taking Viagra had
developed blindness however
is no proof
that Viagra caused
the blindness he
said that men
who take Viagra
often have high
high cholesterol which
are also associated
with the conditions
that can cause

said michael flemming
glaxosmithkline plc we
are confident about
the safety of

flemming levitra Cialis
and Viagra all
work in the
same fashion but
flemming said that
doesn't mean they
all have the
same side effects
every drug is
different every drug
is unique he
said analyst jason
napodano of zacks
investment research inc
said he doesn't think Viagra
sales will stumble
new reports because
cases is so
small it is
too early to
say that Viagra
is causing this
and look how
small the numbers
are he said
Viagra approved to
used by men
with heart conditions
whose doctors have
warned them not

also patients taking
drugs that contain
nitrates have been

Pfizer said in
its most recent
quarterly filing with
the securities and
exchange commission that
sales of the
drug rose 5% — to $438 million in
the first quarter
of the year
Pfizer also said
a 68% worldwide market share
Viagra sales have
been under pressure
from new competitors
with revenue sinking
11% last year to
$1 68 billion
from $1 88 billion
Pfizer shares fell
in early trading
on the new
york stock exchange
doctors and patients
have become increasingly
wary of the
downsides of prescription
drugs after merck
& co yanked its
pain reliever vioxx
from the market
last year because
of its potentially
lethal side effects
merck potentially faces
thousands of lawsuits
over vioxx and
analysts have estimated
its liability may
reach $18 billion Pfizer
was asked to
remove its pain
reliever bextra from
the market because
of its side
effects and sales
of its other
arthritis drug celebrex
are falling vioxx
celebrex and bextra
all fall into
a category of
drugs known as
cox-2 inhibitors industry
critics have been
demanding that drug
companies conduct more
post-marketing studies in
order to do
a better job
of discovering side
effects once drugs
hit the market
for more than
two decades americans
have mostly pressed
for quicker approval
of what they
hope can be
lifesaving drugs for
such diseases as
aids and cancer
but many now
are wondering if
medicines — a $200 billion industry
annually — are coming out
too fast and
doing too much
harm Viagra also
is at the
center of controversy
over medicaid's payment for
prescriptions of the
drug to convicted
sex offenders in
new york and
other states erectile
dysfunction is the
or maintain an
erection sufficiently rigid
for sexual intercourse
sexual drive and
the ability to
have an orgasm
are not necessarily
affected because all
men have erection
problems from time
to time doctors
consider erectile dysfunction
to be present
if attempts at
intercourse fail at
least 25% of the time
erectile dysfunction is
not new in
either medicine or
human experience but
easily or openly
discussed cultural expectations
of male sexuality
inhibit many men
from seeking help
for a disorder
that can usually
benefit from medical
treatment the penis
and erectile function
the structure of
the penis the
penis is composed
of the following
structures: two parallel columns
of spongy tissue
called the corpus
cavernosa or erectile
bodies a central
spongy chamber called
the corpus spongiosum
which contains the
urethra the tube
that carries urine
from the bladder
through the penis
these structures are
made up of
erectile tissue erectile
tissue is rich
in tiny pools
of blood vessels
called cavernous sinuses
each of these
vessels are surrounded
by smooth muscles
and supported by
elastic fibrous tissue
composed of a
protein called collagen
erectile function and
nitric oxide the
penis is either
flaccid or erect
depending on the
state of arousal
in the flaccid
or unerect penis
the following normally
occurs: small arteries leading
to the cavernous
sinuses contract reducing
the inflow of
blood the smooth
muscles regulating the
many tiny blood
vessels also stay
contracted limiting the
amount of blood
that can collect
during arousal the
following occurs: the man's central nervous
system stimulates the
release of a
number of chemicals
including nitric oxide
which is now
considered the main
contributor for eliciting
and maintaining erection
nitric oxide stimulates
production of cyclic
gmp a chemical
that relaxes the
smooth muscles in
the penis this
allows blood to
flow into the
tiny pool-like cavernous sinuses
flooding the penis
this increased blood
flow nearly doubles
the diameter of
the spongy chambers
the veins surrounding
the chambers are
squeezed almost completely
shut by this
pressure the veins
drain blood out
and so the
penis becomes rigid
and erect after
ejaculation or climax
cyclic gmp is
broken down by
an enzyme called
phosphodiesterase-5 causing the
penis to become
flaccid again important
substances for erectile
health a proper
balance of certain
chemicals gases and
other substances is
critical for erectile
health collagen the
protein collagen is
the major component
in structural tissue
in the body
including in the
penis excessive amounts
however form scar
tissue which can
impair erectile function
oxygen oxygen-rich blood is
most important components
for erectile health
oxygen levels vary
widely from reduced
levels in the
flaccid state to
very high in
the erect state
during sleep a
man can normally
have three to
five erections per
night bringing oxygen-rich blood to
the penis testosterone
and other hormones
normal levels of
hormones especially testosterone
are essential for
erectile function though
their exact role
is not clear
oxygen deprivation the
primary cause of
oxygen deprivation is
ischemia the blockage
the same blood
flow-reducing conditions that
lead to heart
disease such as
atherosclerosis may also
contribute to erectile
dysfunction conditions such
as unhealthy cholesterol
levels diabetes and
are associated with
atherosclerosis and heart
disease risk factors
more than 18

and about 600
000 men age
40 - 70 experience erectile

degree each year
age for most
men erectile dysfunction
is primarily associated
with older age
while ed affects
less than 10% of men in
their 20s and
5 - 17% of men in
their 40s about
15 - 34% of men in

men over 60
years old 61% reported being sexually
active and nearly
half derived as
much if not
more emotional benefit
from their sex
lives as they
did in their

dysfunction often has
more to do
with disease than
age itself in
particular older men
are more likely
to have heart
disease diabetes and
than younger men
such conditions and
some of their
treatments are causes
lifestyle factors smoking
smoking contributes to
impotence mainly because
it increases the
effects of other
blood vessel disorders
including high blood
pressure and atherosclerosis
alcohol use heavy
drinking can cause
erectile dysfunction alcohol
depresses the central
nervous system and
impairs sexual function
drug abuse illicit
heroin cocaine methamphetamines
and marijuana can
affect sexual function
lack of exercise
a sedentary lifestyle
can lead to
obesity and other
health problems associated
causes over the
past decades the
medical perspective on
the causes of
erectile dysfunction has
shifted common wisdom
used to attribute
almost all cases
of impotence to
psychological factors now
doctors believe that
up to 85% of impotence cases
are caused by
medical or physical
problems only 15% are completely psychologically
based sometimes erectile
dysfunction is due
to a combination
of physical and
psychological causes a
number of medical
conditions share a
common problem with
erectile dysfunction the
impaired ability of
blood vessels to
open and allow
normal blood flow
heart disease atherosclerosis
and high blood
pressure heart disease
atherosclerosis high blood
pressure and high

and is associated
relationship problems troubles
in relationships often
have a direct
impact on sexual
functioning partners of
dysfunction may feel
rejected and resentful
particularly if the
affected man does
not confide his
own anxieties or
depression tension and
anger frequently arise
between people who
discuss sexual or
emotional issues with
each other it
can be very
difficult for the
man to perform
sexually when both
partners harbor negative
feelings diagnosis the
doctor typically interviews
the patient about
many physical and
psychological factors and
performs a physical
exam medical history
the doctor should
take a medical
and personal history
and may ask
about the following: past and present
medical conditions surgeries
and medications any
history of psychological
problems including stress
anxiety or depression
lifestyle factors such
as alcohol drug
and dietary supplement
use in addition
the doctor will
ask about the
patient's sexual history
which may include: when problems with
sexual function began
the frequency quality
and duration of
any erections and
whether they occur
at night or
in the morning
the specific circumstances
when erectile dysfunction
occurs details of
technique whether problems
exist in the
current relationship if
appropriate the doctor
may also interview
the sexual partner
physical examination the
doctor will perform
a physical exam
including examination of
the genital area
and a digital
rectal examination to
check for prostate
abnormalities it is
important to check
the blood pressure
and to evaluate
the circulation by
checking pulses in
the legs laboratory
tests blood tests
may be used
to measure testosterone
levels to determine
if there are
hormone problems the
doctor may also
screen for thyroid
and adrenal gland
dysfunction in addition
the doctor may
order tests for
blood sugar levels
to check if
diabetes is a
factor for more
sophisticated tests the
doctor may refer
the patient to
a urologist because
atherosclerosis are often
linked it is
cholesterol levels treatment
psychological situations can
and brief periods
of impotence are
normal every man
experiences erectile dysfunction
from time to
time nevertheless if
the problem is
persistent men should
seek professional help
particularly since erectile
dysfunction is usually
treatable and may
also be a
symptom of an
underlying health problem
it is important
to treat any
may be causing
choices drug therapy
with pde5 inhibitors
is the main
dysfunction Sildenafil vardenafil
and Tadalafil are
the three pde5
inhibitor drugs approved
for treatment erectile
dysfunction in general
if a man
is a candidate
for pde5 inhibitor
therapy and is
satisfied with the
results no further
treatment is necessary
pde5 inhibitors are
not safe or
effective for all
men men who
cannot or choose
not to take
the drugs may
have other options
including: medications inserted or
injected into the
penis vacuum devices
surgery ultimately how
successful the medical
treatment is and
how well it
is accepted depends
on the man's expectations and
how he and
his partner both
adapt to the
procedure psychotherapies some
form of psychological
behavioral or sexual
therapy may be
recommended for certain
patients lifestyle changes
no matter what
the treatment embarking
on a healthy
lifestyle is the
first and critical
step for restoring
and maintaining erectile
function lifestyle changes
because many cases
are due to
reduced blood flow
from blocked arteries
to maintain the
same lifestyle habits
as those who
face an increased
risk for heart
disease diet and
exercise diet everyone
should eat a
diet rich in
fresh fruits and
vegetables whole grains
and fiber and
low in saturated
fats and sodium
because erectile dysfunction
may be related
to circulation problems
diets that benefit
the heart are
especially important foods
that some people
claim to have
qualities that enhance
sexual drive include
chilies chocolate scallops
oysters olives and
anchovies no evidence
exists for these
claims exercise a
regular exercise program
can be helpful
alcohol and smoking
men who drink
alcohol should do
so in moderation
quitting smoking is
essential stay sexually
active staying sexually
active may help
prevent impotence frequent
erections stimulate blood
penis change or
reduce medications if
medications are causing
impotence the patient
and doctor should
discuss alternatives or
reduced dosages psychotherapy
and behavioral therapy
even if erectile
dysfunction is caused
by a physical
problem interpersonal supportive
or behavioral therapy
are often helpful
for patients and
their partners herbs
and supplements generally
manufacturers of herbal
remedies and dietary
supplements do not
need FDA approval
to sell their
products just like
a drug herbs
and supplements can
affect the body's chemistry and
therefore have the
potential to produce
side effects that
may be harmful
reported cases of
serious and even
from herbal products
patients should always
check with their
doctors before using
any herbal remedies
or dietary supplements

these drugs all
work equally well
all three are
known as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors by
blocking the pde-5 enzyme these
drugs help the
smooth muscles of
the penis to
relax and increase
blood flow pde5
inhibitors are generally
the first choice
of treatment for
erectile dysfunction candidates
for pde5 inhibitors
a good choice
for men at
any age who
are in good
health and who
do not have
conditions that preclude
taking them however
not suitable for
everyone men who
take nitrate drugs
for angina or
alpha-blockers for high
should not take
pde5 inhibitors the
less effective in
and in men
treated for prostate
cancer men with
the following conditions
pde5 inhibitors without
the recommendation of
their doctors and
even then should
use them with
caution: severe heart disease
such as unstable
angina a recent
heart attack or
arrhythmias men with
heart disease may
benefit from an
exercise test to
determine whether resuming
sexual activity increases
their risk of
recent history of
stroke hypotension uncontrolled
hypertension uncontrolled diabetes
severe heart failure
retinitis pigmentosa administration
and effect pde5
inhibitors work only
when the man
experiences some sexual
arousal they are
generally effective within
15 - 45 minutes Sildenafil
should be taken
on an empty
stomach vardenafil and
Tadalafil may be
without food the
drugs may last
for several hours
and Tadalafil may
last for up
pde5 inhibitors should
not be used
a day success
rates increase with
attempts so a
man should not
be discouraged if
the drug does
not work at
first pde5 inhibitors
can also be
used in combination
with testosterone replacement
therapy for men
with hypogonadism side
effects common side
effects of pde
inhibitors include flushing
upset stomach headache
nasal congestion back
pain and dizziness
effects on the
heart there have
been reports of
fatal heart attacks
in a small
percentage of men
taking Sildenafil Viagra
can cause sudden
and dangerous drops
when the drug
is taken with
nitrate drugs such
as nitroglycerine which
are used for
angina no one
taking nitrates including
amyl nitrate should
take Sildenafil or
any other pde5
inhibitors intercourse itself
involves an increase
in physical exertion
and a small
risk of heart
attack for patients
with known heart
disease or those
at risk visual
effects about 2
5% of men who
take these drugs
develop vision problems
that include seeing
a blue haze
temporary increased brightness
and even temporary
vision loss in
a few cases
the effect is
usually temporary lasting
a few minutes
to several hours
men at risk
for eye problems
who take pde5
inhibitors regularly should
have frequent eye
examinations with an
ophthalmologist men should
also see an
eye doctor if
visual problems last
more than a
few hours in
these drugs have
been associated with
partial vision loss
the vision loss
was caused by
non-arteritic anterior ischemic
optic neuropathy a
condition that occurs
from poor blood
flow to optic
nerves however doctors
note that erectile
dysfunction is itself
linked to the
same vascular problems
that cause naion
patients who suffer
from diabetes high
heart disease are
at higher risk
other vascular problems
such as naion
information concerning vision
loss has been
added to the
labels of these
drugs but the
risk of blindness
appears small still
patients who use
this medication and
experience a sudden
loss of vision
should immediately stop
and contact their
doctor hearing loss
of men have
experienced sudden hearing
loss in one
ear sometimes accompanied
by ringing in
the ears and
dizziness if you
have this symptom
immediately contact your
doctor seizures there
have been a
few reports of
seizures in men
taking Sildenafil these
are rare occurrences
causal association risk
of priapism pde5
inhibitors pose a
very low risk
for priapism in
most men exceptions
are young men
with normal erectile
function interactions with
other drugs in
addition to serious
interactions with nitrates
pde5 inhibitors may
also interact with
certain antibiotics and
acid blockers such
as cimetidine patients
should tell their
doctor about any
other medications they
are taking surgery
and devices vacuum
erection devices vacuum
erection devices also
called vacuum constriction
devices can generally
be used by
all men with
erectile dysfunction patients
must receive thorough
instructions in the
proper use of
such devices they
typically work as
follows: the man places
the penis inside
a plastic cylinder
a vacuum is
created which causes
blood to flow
thereby creating an
erection once an
erection is achieved
the man places
an elastic ring
around the base
to retain the
erection the ring
should remain in
place for no
more than 30
minutes lack of
spontaneity is this
method''s major drawback
penile implants penile
implants are an
who cannot take
medication or for
who less invasive
treatments do not
work in general
they work well
in restoring sexual
function and men
are usually satisfied
with the results
two types of
surgical implants are
used for the
dysfunction: a hydraulic implant
consists of two
cylinders placed within
the erection chambers
and a pump
the pump releases
a saline solution
into the chambers
to cause an
erection and removes
the solution to
deflate the erection
a penile prosthesis
is composed of
two semi-rigid but bendable
rods that are
placed inside the
erection chambers of
penis can then
be manipulated to
an erect or
non-erect position erectile
tissue is permanently
damaged when these
devices are implanted
and these procedures
are irreversible although
uncommon mechanical breakdown
can occur or
the device can
slip or bulge
in addition a
less than optimal
quality of erection
may result infection
is a rare
but serious complication
vascular surgery in
rare cases penile
vascular surgery may
be considered as
dysfunction two types
of operations are
available: revascularization surgery and
venous ligation some
insurance carriers consider
these procedures experimental
and will not
pay for them
american urologic association
men who smoke
or who have
are not candidates
for penile vascular
surgeries: insulin-dependent diabetes widespread
atherosclerosis consistently high
blood cholesterol levels
injured nerves or
damaged blood vessels
revascularization the revascularization
procedure usually involves
taking an artery
from a leg
and then surgically
connecting it to
the arteries at
the back of
the penis bypassing
the blockages and
restoring blood flow
penile arterial revascularization
is appropriate only
for young men
who have blood
vessel injury at
the base of
the pain that
events such as
blunt trauma or
pelvic fracture venous
ligation venous ligation
is performed when
the penis is
unable to store
a sufficient amount
of blood to
maintain an erection
this operation ties
off or removes
veins that are
causing an excessive
to drain from
long-term success rates
for this procedure
are less than
50 percent injections
or topical treatments
treatments using Alprostadil
Alprostadil is derived
from a natural
substance Prostaglandin e1
which opens blood
vessels this medicine
is an effective
treatment for some
men it can
be administered by: injection into the
erectile tissue of
the penis a
system that administers
the drug in
pellets placed in
the urethra candidates
Alprostadil is not
an appropriate choice
for men with: severe circulatory or
nerve damage bleeding
abnormalities or men
medications that thin
the blood such
as heparin or
warfarin penile implants
injected Alprostadil injected
Alprostadil uses a
very small needle
that the man
injects into the
his penis about
80% of men describe
the pain of
administering the injection
as very mild
the drug should
not be injected
more than 3
times a week
or more than
once within a
24-hour period muse
system the muse
system delivers Alprostadil
through the urethra
it works in
the following way: the device is
a thin plastic
tube with a
button at the
top the man
inserts the tube
into his urethral
opening right after
urination he presses
the button which
releases a pellet
containing Alprostadil the
man rolls his
penis between his
hands for 10
- 30 seconds to
evenly distribute the
drug to avoid
discomfort the man
should keep the
penis as straight
as possible during
administration the man
should be upright
for about 10
minutes after administration
by that time
he should have
achieved an erection
that lasts 30
- 60 minutes the
erection may continue
after orgasm the
muse system should
more than twice
a day and
is not appropriate
abnormal penis anatomy
most Alprostadil methods
certain side effects
are common to
all methods of
administration although they
may differ in
severity depending on
how the drug
is given: pain and burning
at the application
site scarring of
the penis which
is most likely
to occur with
injections sudden low
blood pressure symptoms
include dizziness lightheadedness
and fainting if
these symptoms occur
the man should
lie down immediately
with his legs
raised priapism possible
with any method
but less chance
with the muse
system than with
injections if priapism
occurs applying ice
for 10-minute periods to
the inner thigh
may help reduce
blood flow erections
that last 4
hours or longer
require emergency care
women partners may
experience vaginal burning
or itching the
drug may have
toxic effects if
it reaches the
fetus in pregnant
women so men
should not use
Alprostadil for intercourse
with pregnant women
without the use
of a condom
or other barrier
contraceptive device other
side effects include
minor bleeding or
spotting redness in
the penis and
aching in the
testicles legs and
area around the
anus injections using
Papaverine and phentolamine
until the introduction
of Alprostadil the
two drugs used
for injection therapy
had been Papaverine
and phentolamine adverse
reactions are usually
minor but include
pain ulcers and
prolonged erections these
drugs are rarely
used now testosterone
replacement therapy testosterone
replacement therapy works
best for men
with ed who
have been diagnosed
with hypogonadism men
who have ed
and normal testosterone
levels are not
likely to benefit
from testosterone therapy
studies indicate that
testosterone therapy can
modestly improve erectile
function and libido
forms of testosterone
therapy include: muscle injections using
testosterone enanthate or
cypionate skin patch
brand patches may
be applied daily
to the skin
of the scrotum
or to the
abdomen back thighs
or upper arm
skin gel the
gel is applied
only to the
shoulders upper arms
or abdomen not
directly to the
penis it is
extremely important that
men thoroughly wash
their hands with
soap and water
after applying the
gel and cover
the application site
with clothing once
it dries testosterone
gel has caused
serious side effects
in children who
have come in
contact with it
through secondary exposure
pregnant women must
avoid contact with
the gel because
the testosterone can
harm the fetus
oral forms of
testosterone are not
recommended because of
the risk for
liver damage when
taken for long
periods of time
include acne breast
enlargement headache and
emotional instability testosterone
therapy may increase
the following serious
side effects: rapid growth of
prostate tumors in
men with existing
prostate cancers benign
prostatic hyperplasia enlargement
of the prostate
gland liver disease
and possibly liver
cancer worsening of
sleep apnea especially
in men who
are obese or
who have lung
conditions an erection
problem occurs when
a man can't get or
that is firm
enough for intercourse
you may not
be able to
get an erection
at all or
you may lose
the erection during
intercourse before you
are ready erection
problems usually don't affect your
sex drive erection
problems are common
almost all adult
men have trouble
getting or keeping
an erection at
one time or
another often the
problem goes away
with little or
no treatment but
for some men
an ongoing problem
this is called
erectile dysfunction if
you have trouble
an erection more
than 25% of the time
you should see
your doctor an
erection involves your
brain nerves hormones
and blood vessels
anything that interferes
with these normal
functions can lead
to problems getting
an erection common
causes of erection
problems include: diseases such as
pressure heart or
thyroid conditions poor
blood flow depression
or nervous system
disorders medicines including
blood pressure medications
heart medications some
peptic ulcer medications
sleeping pills and
antidepressants nerve damage
from prostate surgery
nicotine alcohol or
cocaine use poor
communication with your
partner repeated feelings
of doubt and
failure spinal cord
injury stress fear
anxiety or anger
unrealistic sexual expectations
which make sex
a task instead
of a pleasure
erection problems become
more common with
age however they
can affect men
at any age
physical causes are
more common in
older men emotional
causes are more
common in younger
men low levels
of testosterone can
lead to erection
problems they may
also reduce a
man's sex drive
for many men
lifestyle changes can
help: cut down on
smoking alcohol and
illegal drug use
get plenty of
rest and take
time to relax
exercise and eat
a healthy diet
to keep good
blood circulation use
safe sex practices
to prevent hiv
and stds talk
openly to your
partner about sex
and your relationship
if you cannot
do this counseling
can help couples
who cannot talk
are likely to
have problems with
sexual intimacy men
who have trouble
talking about their
feelings may find
it hard to
share their anxiety
about sexual performance
counseling can help
both you and
your partner call
your doctor if: the problem does
not go away
with lifestyle changes
the problem begins
after an injury
or prostate surgery
you have other
symptoms such as
low back pain
abdominal pain or
a change in
urination if erection
problems seem to
be caused by
a medication you
are taking talk
to your health
care provider you
may need to
lower the dose
or change to
another drug do
not change or
stop taking any
medications without first
health care provider
talk to your
problems have to
do with a
fear of heart
problems sexual intercourse
is usually safe
heart problems call
away or go
to an emergency
room if the
medication you are
taking for erection
problems gives you
an erection that
lasts for more
recently a reader
complained to me
that she and
her husband no
longer have sex
it wasnt that
they didn't care
about each other
they simply couldnt
afford it the
problem was that
her husband suffered
from erectile dysfunction
or e d
afflicts about a
third of men
in their 50s
and half of
men in their
60s and for
couples on a
limited budget the
cost of drugs
like Viagra at
about $15 a pill
can be prohibitive
to use on
a regular basis
insurance plans don't
cover the cost
of e d
drugs but as
lesley alderman explains
in todays patient
money there are
a range of
options for treating
erectile dysfunction including
pumps injections and
surgical implants many
of them are
covered by insurance

read the full
story Viagra and
its ilk arent
the only treatments
around and then
please join the
discussion below have
you found success
with any of
these treatments? is the cost
of treating e
d taking a
toll on your
sex life? sleep apnea causes
disrupted breathing in
the middle of
the night for
more than 12
million americans fatigue
and weight gain
are some of
its more familiar
symptoms but a
growing body of
research has also
found that sleep
apnea can be
a drain on
intimacy causing erectile
and loss of
libido in women
scientists suspect this
may have to
do with sex
hormones like testosterone
which rise with
sleep and fall
when there is
a lack of
it because it
causes intermittent waking
and chronic sleep
deprivation apnea may
directly drive down
levels of these
hormones causing sexual
dysfunction in the
most recent study
published last month
of sexual medicine
scientists compared 80
women with obstructive
sleep apnea between
the ages of
28 and 64
with 240 women
without the condition
they found that
the apnea patients
had significantly higher
rates of sexual
dysfunction their findings
echoed those of
earlier studies on
women and apnea
in 2009 researchers
looked for signs
of sexual problems
in 401 men
who showed up
at a clinic
for suspected sleep
apnea of those
who received the
diagnosis about 70
percent also had
erectile dysfunction compared
with 34 percent
in those without
sleep apnea but
on the bright
side treatment can
make a difference
patients who undergo
surgery to correct
facial abnormalities that
contribute to apnea
see improvements in
intimacy and those
who start using
masks at night
that administer continuous
positive airway pressure
also report benefits
in their sexual
relationships lifestyle changes

promoted as treatments
and sexual enhancement
not approved any
of these products
in recent years
banned from the
market many of
these dietary supplements
and warns that
they contain the

pde5 inhibitor prescription
drugs used in
levitra facing generic
competition for its
Pfizer recently started
selling a chewable
in mexico it
is called Viagra
jet and Pfizer
says it may
also market it
to other nations
in the developing
world if not
levitra another erectile
dysfunction drug is
now sold as
a dissolvable tablet
in nine European
countries and may
come to american
pharmacies as soon
as this month
staxyn that new
drug which fizzes
and dissolves in
seconds is marketed
in a pocket-size midnight-black box for
men who prefer
to take it
discreetly without water
the third drug
to reach the
market Cialis now
eight years old
is racing ahead
of the others
because of two
ideas that have
proven extremely popular: an everyday pill
and a 36-hour weekender Cialis
is projected to
become the top-selling of the
three drugs in
the world this
year passing Viagra
drugs to correct
passed $5 billion a
year from sales
to tens of
millions of men
increasingly being driven
by novel applications
to compete with
the lower-priced generics on
the horizon gimmick
is a strong
word but all
of this is
designed to create
new brand identities
dr joseph p
alukal an assistant
professor and director
of reproductive health
at the new
york university school
of medicine said
a newer product
less expensive and
a new form
of taking it
— all that might
convince more people
to try it
research is also
under way in
brazil on a
faster-acting form of
the drugs which
by relaxing smooth
muscle cells while
the existing pills
enter the bloodstream
indirectly by way
of the stomach
intestines and liver
this form would
enter more directly
dissolving in a
capillary-rich space under
the tongue and
flow within 10
or 15 minutes
the research in
brazil involves generic
Viagra but Pfizer
says it is
not sponsoring the
work the Mexican
experiment with Viagra
jet will show
whether the chewable
drug has promise
in other countries
particularly developing markets
susan oconnor Pfizers
global commercial development
said in an
interview studies showed
most Mexican men
who used Viagra
ground it up
to make it
easier to swallow
or in the
belief it would
start acting faster
main story in
explaining why the
drug is being
test-marketed in mexico
ms oconnor cited
patient preference found
in market research
mexico is the
biggest market for
developing world with
about $55 million in
sales last year
at this point
Pfizer does not
have plans to
bring Viagra jet
to the united
states she said
in america Pfizer
is battling to
keep low-price generic competition
off the shelves
a year from
now when the
drugs patent expires
the generic pills
would cost only
a fraction of
the $10 or more
that each pill
now costs Bayer
meanwhile has introduced
the dissolvable form
of its levitra
drug in austria
france hungary germany
spain poland sweden
denmark and britain
where it went
on sale in
late march the
drug is called
levitra odt for
orodispersible tablets it
thin black package
the size of
a half-dozen stacked credit
cards with four
pills on a
card that slides
out its pocket-friendly discreet and
gives the product
a playful edge
over its competitors
thomas proske global
brand manager for
levitra at Bayer
healthcare said in
a statement the
same pill was
approved in the
united states last
june under the
brand name staxyn
it will be
available in pharmacies
this month according
to jess macnaught
marketing executive with
burgopak design and
packaging the london
company that designed
the new black
package glaxosmithkline and
merck have licensed
american rights from
Bayer but they
declined to reveal
would be introduced
last year they
said staxyn would
reach the market
in late 2010
worldwide sales of
grew 6 9
percent in 2010
to about $5 billion and
4 7 percent
in 2009 according
to the industry
health dr alukal
of new york
university said he
thought staxyn could
be sold for
a much lower
price than what
levitra and other
pills now cost
in part to
compete with a
generic Viagra no
price has been
revealed i guess
it could be
easier to ingest
so it could
expand its market
somewhat but in
the end the
bigger issue would
be cost dr
alukal said he
said the companies
for whom he
does not consult
had talked about
lower pricing perhaps
to under $10 a pill
but for now
Pfizer the company
that started it
all is focusing
its attention on
protecting the pricing
power and brand
integrity of Viagra
patrick ford a
former f b
i agent who
leads the companys
security operations in
the americas says
Viagra is the
most counterfeited product
in the world
his agents pose
as buyers collect
evidence and bring
fraud cases to
prosecutors and he
says fake Viagra
may be unsafe
Pfizer and other
working with victoria
angelica espinel the
governments intellectual property
enforcement coordinator a
position president obama
appointed her to
in 2009 Pfizer
is also using
its legal firepower
against would-be generic competitors
Pfizer has two
patents for Viagra
one for its
chemical expiring in
2012 and the
other for its
use against impotence
expiring in 2019
Pfizer sued teva
pharmaceutical industries the
biggest generic-drug company in
march 2010 under
the use patent
the suit is
pending in a
Virginia federal court
mackay jimeson a
Pfizer spokesman said
the company was
confident it would
keep the 2019
patent protection but
industry analysts disagree
use patents are
not highly probable
of being upheld
in court said
c anthony butler
a barclays capital
pharmaceuticals analyst most
if not all
analysts assume the
expiry of the
drug upon expiry
of the composition
of matter patent
the chemical patent
expires on march
27 2012 Pfizer
may be able
to extend it
another six months
to september 2012
under a federal
law called the
best pharmaceuticals for
children act the
law is meant
to encourage drug
companies to study
childrens uses often
a difficult and
unprofitable area in
this case what
would be studied
is not Viagra
for children but
revatio a formulation
of the same
chemical Sildenafil which
is approved for
a rare and
dangerous condition affecting
hundreds of children
states mr jimeson
said the company
was working closely
with the food
to discuss the
pediatric studies of
revatio and the
potential for an
extension on the
chemical patent which
would also protect
Viagra and its
prices many men
though have waited
years for a
lower-priced Viagra and
their wish may
come true next
year other researchers
are testing new
uses for Viagra
that Pfizer says
financing boston university
is studying it
with testosterone gel
in men 40
to 70 laboratório
teuto brasileiro in

effect in 10
minutes or so
Pfizer owns 40
lab but says
not initiate the
study eli lilly

has no plans
to try chewable
or dissolvable or
any other forms
of its Cialis

should it? Cialis sales have
steadily increased since
it was introduced
in 2003 to
$1 7 billion
last year close
to Viagras $1 9 billion

researchers now say
that for men
over 40 having
trouble getting or
maintaining an erection
is often a
sign of something
more worrying: cardiovascular disease indeed
theres growing consensus
that erection problems
are a risk
factor for heart
disease right up
there with smoking
pressure the penis
is the dipstick
of the bodys
health said dr
harry fisch director
reproductive center at
columbia university medical
center of new
york presbyterian hospital
if youre able
and healthy erections
sign that your
cardiovascular system is
in good shape
if you cant
its time to
see your doctor
impotence — or erectile dysfunction
as its sometimes
called — was once deemed
chiefly a psychological
problem when it
occurs in men
and 30s it
often is but
especially when men
hit middle age
the main cause
is almost always
vascular said dr
laurence levine professor
rush university medical
center in chicago
the same factors
that can clog
up arteries and
attacks and strokes
— smoking elevated cholesterol
inflammation and high
blood pressure — also wreak havoc
on the blood
flagging erection may
the earliest warning
signs of trouble
the arteries in
the penis are
about one-third the size
of one of
supplying the heart
dr levine explained
when smaller blood
vessels such as
the penile arteries
are compromised even
a small amount
it can have
a major effect
on their capacity
to dilate and
that will show
up as a
noticeable difference in
the quality of
a man becomes
aroused the brain
sends signals to
release a chemical
that rapidly widens
blood vessels blood
rushes in causing
an erection damage
to those vessels
can make them
inflexible limiting their
ability to expand
when the damage
gets bad enough
the spirit may
be willing but
the flesh unable
since men are
all too aware
when their erections
begin to flag
erectile dysfunction may
serve as a
useful early warning
sign of cardiovascular
problems in a
british study that
compared 207 men
with heart disease
with 165 healthy
controls investigators at
buckinghamshire chilterns university
college found that
erectile woes can
precede such problems
as a heart
attack or angina
by up to
five years what
you really worry
about is the
guy who goes
online and gets
Viagra never knowing
that the reason
hes having problems
is that hes
got very high
cholesterol levels and
is diabetic said
dr wayne j
hellstrom professor of
urology at tulane
medicine in new
orleans and co-author of a
2007 study that
more risk factors
a man has
for coronary artery
disease the greater
his odds of
having abnormal blood
flow in his
penis the poorest
blood flow showed
up in men
who already had
and diabetes to
complicate matters certain
prescription drugs — including some
high-blood-pressure medicines
cholesterol-lowering 
drugs antidepressants
and tranquilizers — can cause or
worsen erection problems
twenty-five percent of
medications said dr
kevin t mcvary
professor of urology
at the feinberg
school of medicine
at northwestern university
in chicago sometimes
doctors can switch
patients to a
similar drug that
doesnt cause problems
in that case
we have to
treat around the
side effect usually
by prescribing a
dr mcvary said
in some men
getting high blood
pressure and cholesterol
under control along
with stepping up
physical activity and
shedding a few
pounds may be
enough to improve
erections after participating
in a program
to lose weight
and get more
exercise for example
one group of
55 obese men
studied at the
university of naples
in italy significantly
bettered their scores
on a test
called the international
index of erectile
function studies have
shown that a
diet abundant in
fruits vegetables whole
grains and fish
like that traditionally
eaten in the
mediterranean region may
also help by
reducing vascular inflammation
if a healthier
diet means losing
weight all the
better people with
huge pot bellies
typically have very
low testosterone the
male hormone dr
fisch explained visceral
fat eats up
testosterone when men
lose belly fat
their testosterone goes
up so does
their libido and
the most obvious
manifestation of it
exercise is also
important he said
because it helps
open up blood
vessels of course
diet and exercise
are a tough
sell when a
simple pill can
do the trick
quickly treatment of
impotence has undergone
a revolution with
the advent of
Viagra and two
similar drugs levitra
and Cialis all
three work by
blocking the breakdown
of the chemical
that causes blood
vessels in the
penis to widen
that in turn
allows more of
the chemical to
build up bolstering
an erection despite
the happy images
of smiling silver-haired 
couples in
the ads however
erectile dysfunction medications
may not work
for everyone if
blood vessels become
too damaged they
cant widen sufficiently
30 percent of
the men we
see don't get
much improvement using
these drugs dr
levine said for
some of them
exercise and weight
loss may increase
the pills effectiveness
as may lowering
elevated cholesterol levels
with cholesterol-lowering 
statin drugs
the findings underscore
the importance that
men 40 and
older see a
doctor and treat
cardiovascular risk factors
if erection problems
arise as for
younger men the
latest findings are
even more encouraging
heeding the familiar
advice to maintain
a normal weight
exercise and avoid
smoking could well
ensure sturdier erections
for years to
come thats potent
motivation by any
